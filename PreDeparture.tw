:: Todo
/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
* Remove console.logs related to the registration submission work.
* Add a hidden field to the Jotform to receive the referring page.
* Add index URL to Thank You HTML page.
* Upgrade to latest SugarCube and fix resulting CSS issues.
* When new versions that rearrange, delete, or add passages come out, it is necessary to delete SugarCube's saves and options. Test new code in ::Version & Reset.
* Convert checkmark .svg into a .png.
* Add to credits, including Twine and SugarCube folks.
* Incorporate Ruth's content images.
* Incorporate Ruth's background images.
* Set up robots.txt in new web directory: http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html
* Check out iPad sometime failure to display background image when animating title.
* Look at recording history of what was actually read along with visible data in JotForm
* Add full list of resources to What To Do Next (Mei's suggestion).
* Add warning dialogue for Android default browser, maybe iPads (or prevent dramatic titles on iPads).
* Add an index button to appear in the header after finishing the registration or hitting the Credits page.
* Fix index display on wider aspect ratio Chrome.
* Add iOS metas:
	<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
	<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icon.png" /> (icon for users' desktop if saved as webapp)
	http://davidbcalhoun.com/2010/using-mobile-specific-html-css-javascript/

* Find source of the "none" image that the presentation attempts to load. Difficult to find so far. All indications are that this is not actually an image, but from the snap.js external javascript.
* iOS app icon template: http://appicontemplate.com/
* Add an emergency plan for download, with blanks that student can fill in for local info.
* Safari 5.1: Sometimes(?) the menu help tooltip stays onscreen when the following tip is shown. This may have been fixed, though.
* Comment out all console.log references DONE
* Uncomment save options code in special-StoryInit.tw (macros.get("saveoptions").handler();) DONE
* Scrolling doesn't work on iPad on first page until after rotating the screen. Other pages work fine. Fixed by increasing timeout value to 300 in PassageDone: if (typeof customScroll != "undefined") { setTimeout(function () { customScroll.refresh(); customScroll.scrollTo(0, 0); }, 300); DONE
* Fix continued iPad failure to autoscroll/auto-calculate height correctly. UPPED THE DELAY TO 600MS
* Lots of problems with the implementation of the back button on sidebars if the user doesn't get to the sidebar via the standard route. DONE - simplified 
* DONE add prefixes to all CSS! Use http://pleeease.io/play/, browser string: Opera >=12, Chrome >= 20, Firefox >= 10, iOS > 6.0, Explorer > 10, FirefoxAndroid > 1, ChromeAndroid >= 20, Safari > 5.1 
* Update URL replacement code on index page to take hash mode into account: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/4/#inbox/146a53697f731793 DONE, I think
* Trevor reports possible issue with nav menu and continue button after submitting registration form. (He also says that Continue button appears on last page, which it shouldn't.) Safari 7.0.6 FIXED, I think. Was actually a problem with multiple click handlers being attached on the index page.
* Make registration form submission set a flag so that it won't appear again after you've submitted it once. NEARLY COMPLETE: Change flag to be directly stored, rather than a variable. http://twinery.org/forum/index.php/topic,1932.msg5202.html#msg5202 DONE


Browser requirements:
* Firefox 5+
* Internet Explorer 10
* Safari 5.1
* Android 4.3
* Mobile Safari 6.1+


NOTES
* Keep all background images at 1440x900 (http://www.webmalama.com/the-best-full-screen-background-image-sizes-for-web-design/)
* Use smaller images with an overlay to mask image degradation? --Doesn't seem necessary http://solemone.de/demos/fullsize-background-image-with-css3-background-size/
* iOS resolutions: http://www.iosres.com/
* Consider conversion of some resources to data URIs: http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/
