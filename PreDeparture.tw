* Add sidebars to drawer navigation.

* Remove visible sound references.
* Add browser support information and especially pointer to menu.
* Why are index items incorrectly ordered in the drawer on Android 4.3?
* Install 
* Increase size of checkbox in drawer on mobile.
* minify iScroll.
* Update URL replacement code on index page to take hash mode into account: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/4/#inbox/146a53697f731793
* Consider adding fast click to improve responsiveness on mobile: https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick
* iOS app icon template: http://appicontemplate.com/
* Add an emergency plan for download, with blanks that student can fill in for local info.
* Put header on About this Presentation as well--?
* Add iOS metas:
	<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
	<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icon.png" /> (icon for users' desktop if saved as webapp)
* Doesn't work in Safari 5.1--something breaks.
* Console shim in IE 9 seems to *almost* totally fix things--I got a random error that affected nothing substantive about console being undefined.
* Remove all console.log references (needed for IE9)
* Uncomment save options code in special-StoryInit.tw (macros.get("saveoptions").handler();)

Browser requirements:
* Firefox 10+
* Internet Explorer 10 (maybe 9)
* Safari 5.1


NOTES
* Keep all background images at 1440x900 (http://www.webmalama.com/the-best-full-screen-background-image-sizes-for-web-design/)
* Use smaller images with an overlay to mask image degradation? --Doesn't seem necessary http://solemone.de/demos/fullsize-background-image-with-css3-background-size/
* iOS resolutions: http://www.iosres.com/
* Consider conversion of some resources to data URIs: http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/

IPAD issues
* Vertical mode: too narrow, probably needs to be full-width (no images) COMPLETE
* Get rid of rubberbanding?
* Scrolling causes weird delayed jumps in the placement of the background image
* Control bar seems to be shifted left by a pixel or so.
* Bizarre control bar behavior during and after zoom ()
