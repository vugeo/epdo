V!Vanderbilt policy on alcohol abroad\u000a!!!!Be aware of legal rules and cultural norms\u000aIn all of the countries where Vanderbilt has approved study abroad programs, the drinking age is lower than it is here in Nashville. While your legal status abroad may be different, you should remember that violations of law or of institutional policy overseas may also become grounds for disciplinary action both at Vanderbilt and under the rules of your abroad program.\u000a\u000aAt the same time that you are considering the legal implications of drinking, be mindful of ''cultural norms'' surrounding alcohol use in your host country. In many countries, for example, American-style "binge drinking" may appear pathological or merely pathetic. Take the opportunity to see cultural practices in a new light. \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!The Student Handbook says:|\u000a|Students are required to abide by the laws of the respective countries in which they reside, study, or travel, with respect to the age at which alcoholic beverages may be consumed. Otherwise, the policies with respect to [[alcoholic beverages and controlled substances|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcoholic-beverage-and-controlled-substances-policies/]] included in the Vanderbilt //Student Handbook// apply. Students are subject to student-accountability sanctions, including expulsion, and referral for prosecution for violation of these policies.|\u000a|<hr>//From// [[VU Student Handbook, Study Abroad|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/university-policies-and-regulations/#study-abroad]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Sexual misconduct abroad">>\u005c

For most Vanderbilt students studying abroad, this will be the United States">home country</span>. You are part of a worldwide web of interactions, and the impression you make on the people of your <span title="The country you are studying abroad in, i.e. the country that is 'hosting' you.">host country</span> definitely reflects on where you come from.\u000a\u000aTake some time to learn about norms in the country you're visiting so that you can attempt to blend in socially. Beyond that, treat those you meet courteously and with sensitivity toward cultural differences. Remember, you are in their world.\u000a\u000aYou are ''subject to local laws''--including measures related to COVID-19--while you are abroad. Foreign laws and legal systems may be quite different from those in your home country, and you should get to know the key differences. If you break local laws while abroad, //neither Vanderbilt nor your country's embassy can get you out of jail//, though both may be able to offer some support. If you have legal troubles while abroad, contact both VIRT (see below) and your home country's embassy.\u000a<<if (not $vanderbilt) and (not $facultyled)>>\u000aWhether you are studying abroad at a university or on a smaller program with one of GEO's partners, you must also ''follow that institution's rules and policies''. These institutions may sanction or dismiss you if you violate their rules. //Dismissal from an abroad program will have the same consequences for your GPA and four-year plan as a dismissal from Vanderbilt!

V!Tips for packing\u000a!!!!Pack light and pack smart\u000aIn GEO's experience, students experience two primary difficulties with packing: They bring too much stuff, and they often don't plan well enough for their specific destination. Here are some tips to help out.\u000a\u000a''Research your location's climate'' and the prevailing weather patterns for the time you will be there, and pack accordingly. Wikipedia is a good source for basic climate data on nearly every city in the world (just search for your city), but commercial guidebooks are probably the single best source of information. \u000a\u000aIf you are going to a ''tropical location'', one of the most important things you can do to avoid contracting a tropical disease (such as Zika, malaria, or dengue) is to protect yourself from mosquito bites. See the [[Traveler Checklist|https://geo.vanderbilt.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=14068]] for more information.\u000a\u000a''Bring only //one// suitcase,'' one you can lift and maneuver without help. If you bring a backpack as your carry-on, it can double as a weekend travel bag.\u000a\u000a''Consider bringing a light duffel bag'' that you can fold up and put in your large suitcase. You may need it to bring the things you buy abroad back home.\u000a\u000aOnly ''pack wardrobe pieces that are interchangeable'' and are good for layering. If it can\u2019t be used to make multiple outfits, it doesn\u2019t belong in your suitcase! Items that can be dressed up or dressed down are ideal.\u000a\u000aFor more tips and a detailed list of suggestions, download GEO's [[Traveler Checklist|https://geo.vanderbilt.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=14068]].\u000a\u000a<<segue "Traveling while abroad">>\u005c

V!Passport and Document Security\u000a!!!!Keep your passport and other key documents safe\u000aWhen you are abroad, no single document is more important than your passport. Without it, ''you will not be able to cross international borders'', and other tasks--such as transferring funds--may also become difficult or impossible. Losing your passport can be a major headache, and might even cost you thousands of dollars in airfare for missed flights. Do everything you can to keep it safe.\u000a<img alt="Passport wallet" src="images/passport wallet.jpg" class="right" style="height: 250px;" />\u005c\u000a\u000aIn general, you should keep your passport on your person only when you are traveling across borders. Otherwise, ''find a safe place for it and leave it there.'' Make a photocopy and carry that on you when you are out and about.\u000a\u000aIf you must carry your passport with you, keep it in a special ''passport wallet'' under your clothes.\u000a\u000aYour passport is not your only critical document. ''Vaccination records, particularly your COVID-19 vaccination record,'' deserve the same care. Take the original with you overseas, but also take a photocopy of these documents to carry around with you when you are out.\u000a\u000aWe also recommend keeping a scan of your passport information page, vaccination records, credit cards, and other important documents on a ''cloud service such as Google Drive or iCloud''. This will give you another way to access them if you lose the photocopy.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!(Potentially) Good Places to Keep Your Passport|\u000a|Hidden in the room of your homestay or residence hall|\u000a|In your hotel's safe (//not// the room safe)|\u000a|With your study abroad provider, if they offer such a service|\u000a|<hr>//In some situations, even these options may not be secure.

V!Traveling while abroad\u000a!!!!Important things to keep in mind when planning travel\u000aMany programs may provide opportunities for independent travel. First, always ''keep your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director or program staff<</if>> informed'' of your travel. Don't forget to keep your family in the loop; if there is an emergency back home, they will want to know how to get in touch with you.\u000a<div class="talkbox">\u000a|box|k\u000a|!COVID-19 Considerations|\u000a|You cannot count on being able to travel to other countries independently while you are on your program. There may be restrictions on non-essential travel between countries, even within normally open regional blocs like the EU. New restrictions could be put in place at any time, including while you are traveling! Your program may also impose restrictions out of an abundance of caution.|\u000a|Even if travel is possible, it may be more difficult than before. Before you set out, be sure that you understand requirements to enter other countries as well as requirements to return to your host country. Always carry your essential travel documents when you travel, including passport and proof of vaccination!|\u000a</div>\u000aSome countries that you plan to visit may have different entry requirements than your primary host country. ''Investigate all the countries you're interested in'' before you leave the US. If any require a <span title="A stamp or sticker placed in your passport that allows you to enter a foreign country.">travel visa</span>, it will probably be easier to get the visa while you're in the US--this applies to both international students and US citizens!\u000a\u000aIn every country you visit, make a point of knowing where your ''home country's nearest embassy or consulate'' is. You want to know where you can find support if you get into real trouble. (If you're a US citizen, you should bookmark the [[list of US embassies around the world|http://www.usembassy.gov/]].)\u000a\u000aAs you make travel plans, consider the ''ecological impact'' of your travel. Per person, [[airplane travel|https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year]] generally emits far more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than travel by train, bus, or automobile. Think about whether you really need to leave your host city so often, and about whether you can use alternative transport that would reduce your carbon footprint.\u000a\u000aFinally, independent travel is one of the ''most expensive activities'' you can undertake abroad. Be sure to budget appropriately, and remember to consider safety while you're on the lookout for ways to travel on the cheap.\u000a<<if not $facultyled>><div class="talkbox">\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Wisdom from alums|\u000a|Every year, students tell us that while they loved the traveling they did abroad, they also regretted not getting to know their host city better.

V!Traveling with medications\u000a!!!!Ensure continuity in your medical care\u000aDrugs that are regularly prescribed in the US can sometimes be restricted abroad. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be interdicted overseas. Take precautions when traveling to ensure that your medications don't get you into trouble.\u000a\u000a''Keep all of your medications in their original packaging'' when traveling. This will trigger less suspicion from customs agents and law enforcement.\u000a\u000aTo find out if any of your medications are restricted or banned in your host country, you can work with healthcare providers at [[Vanderbilt Student Health|https://www.vumc.org/student-health/]] or the [[University Counseling Center|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/]], or with the [[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]]. You can also contact the country's embassy. Ask about over-the-counter drugs too if they are a part of your regular care regime.\u000a\u000aWhatever the legal status of your medications, ''request a letter from your physician'' explaining why the drugs you are transporting have been prescribed to you. Also include over-the-counter drugs if needed. You will want to take this letter with you //whenever you travel!// Request that your doctor use the local brand names or generic/chemical names for your drugs (see resources below).\u000a\u000aWhen possible, ''take enough medicine with you to cover your entire stay abroad''. If your medicine is only available in limited supply, or your doctor prefers that you have a clinician onsite to refill your prescription, please discuss with your physician and program staff how you will obtain enough for your stay. \u000a\u000aBe aware that medications ''cannot be sent through the mail!''\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]], for personal guidance on international insurance, health and wellness, and safety for all travelers|\u000a|[[MedlinePlus|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]], information on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including generic/chemical names|\u000a|[[GeoBlue Drug Translation Guide|https://members.geobluestudents.com/TranslationTools/DrugEquivalents]], offers equivalent brand names and availability for frequently visited countries/destinations|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Tips for packing">>\u005c

V!Money\u000a!!!!Use debit and credit cards wisely to save money\u000aThe amount of money you spend while studying abroad will vary depending on the local cost of living, your personal spending habits, independent travel, and so on. //How you access your money// can also play a role in maintaining your budget.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!COVID-19 Considerations|\u000a|Due to concerns about the spreading of COVID-19, ''use of cash may be discouraged in your host country''. Be prepared to rely on debit or credit cards and/or other cashless methods of payment.| \u000a\u000aMany businesses will not accept plastic, especially for smaller purchases, so it's a good idea to have ''cash'' on hand throughout your time abroad. The most cost-effective way to get cash abroad is to use your ''debit card'' (not a credit card!) in an ATM. You can usually find out where the ATMs you might need are before you leave the US--ask your bank how.\u000a\u000aGEO also recommends that you bring a ''credit card''. Be aware that every credit card purchase or debit card withdrawal will likely carry transaction fees. Shop around a bit for the best rates before you leave the US, but also minimize the number of times you use your cards. Take out as much cash as you feel comfortable with each time you use the ATM, and use your credit card only when necessary or when you have an especially large purchase.\u000a\u000aSome merchants will offer to convert your purchase into dollars before your card payment. GEO does not recommend this practice\u2014you will be charged sometimes quite high exchange rates and fees for the privilege. Make the effort to ''learn how to mentally convert your host country's currency'' on the fly instead!\u000a\u000aBefore you depart the US, and before traveling to a new country, you should ''inform your bank(s) of your location.'' If you don't, you may find your cards canceled as an anti-fraud measure! \u000a\u000aMuch of the rest of the world, including Europe, uses a slightly different technology for credit cards (chip-and-PIN) from the type that is most commonly used in the United States (chip-and-signature). This shouldn't cause you much headache, but it may mean that once in a while you can't complete a transaction. See the In-Depth Information section below for more information on US-issued cards.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Summary|\u000a|Before you leave, consider seeking out the US banks with the best currency conversion and transaction fees for your host country.|\u000a|Call your bank(s) to let them know you'll be abroad.

V<<sidebar "Basics of budgeting">>\u000aBudgeting can be crucial to ensure you have enough money to fund your study abroad experience. There are really two levels of budgeting that you need to keep in mind.\u000a\u000aFirst is the ''overall budget for your study abroad experience''. Getting a ballpark figure for this will help you and your family determine an appropriate weekly budget for you while you are abroad. Be sure to include not only the costs that are billed through Vanderbilt, but also the clear, fixed costs that you will pay out of pocket. Examples include: passport fees, visa fees, airfare, luggage fees, and purchase of clothing or other travel needs.\u000a\u000aTo this, you need to add an estimate of what you will spend on living expenses, entertainment, and enrichment activities. These can be tricky to estimate, especially because a sudden change in currency exchange rates can alter the calculation substantially. <<if $facultyled>>Your faculty leader should be able to give you a better idea of costs on the ground.<<else>>GEO offers rough estimates in our online [[budget sheets|https://vanderbilt.edu/geo/finances/budget-sheets/]], but your program provider can give you a better idea of your costs on the ground. You can also use online cost-of-living calculators (see the Resources section below).<</if>>\u000a\u000aNow that you have a blanket estimate of costs, you and your family can determine how much you should aim to spend per week. Here is where you will need to figure out how to maintain your week-to-week budget while you are abroad. \u000a\u000aA ''week-to-week budget'' is a detailed plan of the money you plan to spend, divided into categories: so much for food, so much for travel, and so on. You may need to revise it as you go. For example, you may overspend one week and need to cut back in future weeks.<<if not $shortterm>> Keep in mind that students often spend more money the first few weeks while becoming acquainted with their new surroundings.<</if>>\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Numbeo|http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/]], international cost of living database and calculator|\u000a|[[Expatistan|http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living]], international cost of living database and calculator|\u000a|[[OANDA|http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/]], currency exchange converter, including historical trends|\u000a|[[Maintain a Personal Budget|http://www.wikihow.com/Maintain-a-Budget-for-Personal-Use]], a general budgeting guide|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Where will you live?">>\u005c

V!Phones and internet abroad\u000a!!!!Basic advice and information\u000a\u000a<<$- "Cell phones">> GEO doesn't recommend one cell phone provider over another, but here are some resources to help you figure out what is best for you. Note that your program may also have cell phone recommendations or even specific requirements for you to follow.\u000a\u000aIf you plan to take your own phone abroad, be sure to check with your phone company for their international plans and rates. Also check their data-roaming fees, since those can rack up fast!\u000a\u000aIt is also possible to leave your phone at home and ''purchase a cheap phone when you arrive''. Or you could buy a cheap unlocked phone before you leave and get the appropriate SIM card when you arrive in your host country. (Some airports sell SIMs in the international arrivals section, so they can be quite easy to come by.)\u000a\u000aYou may want to talk to your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>study abroad provider (or look at their predeparture materials)<</if>> to see if they have specific recommendations on how to handle phones in your host country. You can also visit this [[international cell phone guide|https://www.fcc.gov/international-roaming]] to get a good overview of the options.\u000a\u000a<<$- "Dialing Telephones">> The details of dialing internationally vary depending on which countries you're trying to connect. Check out [[How To Call Abroad|http://www.howtocallabroad.com/]] and share it with family and friends.\u000a\u000a<<$- "Internet">> Internet access abroad is typically not the same as in the US. While you will have access, prepare yourself for slower connections. Depending on your host location, you might have a weekly usage limit in your room or at your college, or you may need to pay for internet access at a cafe. Talk with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program provider or host university<</if>> to find out what to expect.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Communicating with home|Communicating with home]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Disabilities and accommodations">>\u005c

V!Contacts and communications\u000a!!!!Who should I contact for help abroad?\u000aCommunications abroad can seem difficult at first. You need to learn who your best resources are, as well as figure out the most convenient methods of communication within your host country and back home.\u000a\u000aYour <<if $facultyled>>''faculty leader''<<else>>''resident director''<</if>> will be your most reliable contact person: knowledgeable about the program, the host country, and the city. Whether you have a basic question, a scheduling conundrum, or are in the midst of an emergency, your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director<</if>> and on-site staff should be the ''first person you contact.'' You will find out more about who your contact(s) should be in your program-specific predeparture orientation.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling away from your site or your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director<</if>> is not available, you may want to contact Vanderbilt for help. In particular, if you are in an emergency situation or facing a health issue, you can contact  Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT) at +1 615-322-2745.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Hm...">>\u000a   [[When should I contact Vanderbilt or the Global Education Office?|When to contact Vanderbilt]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Phones and internet abroad">>

V!Disabilities and accommodations\u000a!!!!Getting physical and academic accommodations\u000aIf you have registered with Vanderbilt [[Student Access|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/]] to receive academic or physical accommodations at Vanderbilt, you will want to learn whether you can get similar accommodations on your program abroad.\u000a\u000aConsult with Student Access staff and request that they send your accommodations letter to your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program advisor or  on-site staff<</if>>. Do this //before// you depart! Program staff will use this letter in researching what accommodations are possible on site.\u000a\u000aIf you have a disability or challenge that you have so far managed without Student Access, you may want to meet with them before you study abroad. In addition to providing you with a letter, they can help you think through what you might need to ask of your program staff abroad.\u000a\u000aDo understand that while most requests will be honored, laws in other countries regarding required or reasonable accommodations often differ from what is mandated by law in the United States. ''Not all requests can be met exactly.'' For example, the legal status of emotional support animals varies around the world; it may be extremely difficult to incorporate an emotional support animal into many study abroad experiences, depending on the location and specific characteristics of the program.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Student Access|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/]]|\u000a|[[Mobility International USA|http://www.miusa.org/]], resources for travelers with disabilities|\u000a|[[Travelers with Disabilities|http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-8-advising-travelers-with-specific-needs/travelers-with-disabilities]], excellent information on traveling with physical disabilities|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Money">>\u005c

V!Living abroad\u000a!!!!Considerations for life abroad in 2022\u000aMost countries outside the United States have taken more top-down approaches to COVID-19 than the US. Many will have both national and local regulations to follow. Wherever you go, you are likely to find somewhat different COVID rules and more nuance in how those are applied.\u000a\u000aIn particular, response to COVID outbreaks is more likely to involve strict, if temporary, ''lockdowns and targeted shutdowns of services''. These may cause inconvenience, including interrupting classes or travel. It is possible that your coursework might need to go online for an extended period, or that a planned trip may have to be canceled.\u000a\u000aYour university or program will provide guidance on rules and regulations throughout your semester for your host site. If you are looking to travel elsewhere, however, you\u2019ll need to keep up with this information--and travel-specific restrictions--yourself. Consider consulting with Vanderbilt's [[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]] on any independent travel plans.\u000a\u000aWith independent travel likely restricted in many places, ''GEO encourages you to explore your host city and region''. There is a lot to be said for getting to know one area in depth: you develop a more intimate relationship with your surroundings, gain a deeper understanding of the local culture and rhythms of life, and are more likely to begin to see how to live more like locals do. The feeling of competence of mastering the ins and outs of another city is very satisfying.\u000a\u000a''Make use of your program staff\u2019s intimate knowledge of your host city''. They can help you find cool things to do, master transport systems, find safe routes to where you want to go, and more!\u000a\u000aIf your program allows you to live in ''independent housing'', consider carefully. While the freedom of independent housing may be attractive, there are downsides as well. These include the difficulty of navigating unfamiliar regulations and requirements (perhaps in a foreign language), the possibility of predatory landlords, and the difficulty of researching and assessing safety from abroad. One upside is that it can be a real learning experience to navigate the process of finding and renting your own place. If you are finding your own housing, remember that you need to turn in your Study Abroad Housing Policy Waiver Form to GEO before your program begins\u2014and that ''you aren\u2019t cleared to study abroad until we receive it!''\u000a/% !Where will you live?\u000a!!!!<<if $facultyled and ($maymester or $summer)>>Will you need housing on-campus at Vanderbilt?<<else>>What choices do you have in your housing abroad?<</if>>\u000aSome programs offer you the opportunity to select from multiple housing options, including in some cases the option to live in independent housing. <<if not $facultyled>>Which should you choose?\u000a\u000aThe answer, of course, depends on what you are hoping to get out of your time overseas. (If you're not sure what your housing options are, talk to the GEO advisor for your program.)\u000a\u000aBut since you may be facing a choice soon, we want to share with you ''what alumni of Vanderbilt study abroad tell us'' in their program evaluations: Students who live with natives of their host country typically report greater satisfaction with their housing and integration into the local culture than students who live with Americans. This is true whether students lived with a homestay family or with native roommates of their own age.\u000a<<display "Housing chart">>\u000aIf your program allows you to live in ''independent housing'', consider carefully.

V<<sidebar "Where to find crucial information about your medications">>\u000aThere are two pieces of information that will be useful or even critical for you to know about your medications: the legal status of the drug in your host country, and the generic/chemical name and/or the local brand names it goes by.\u000a\u000aTo ''find out if any of your medications are restricted or banned'' in your host country, contact the country's embassy here in the US. The US Department of State provides a [[directory of foreign embassies|https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html]]. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be more restricted abroad, so ask if you have doubts. In some cases, GEO may be able to advise you on whether your prescriptions are legal to carry abroad. Contact your GEO advisor or Vanderbilt's [[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]].\u000a\u000aTo ''find the generic or chemical name'' of a drug, you can check the National Institutes of Health's [[MedlinePlus website|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]]. It may be somewhat trickier to find out the drug's brand name in your host country, but [[this tool|https://members.geobluestudents.com/TranslationTools/DrugEquivalents]] from Vanderbilt's international health insurance provider will provide answers in most cases (requires you to have already been enrolled in GeoBlue, in order to have an account for online access--GEO will enroll you prior to departure.).\u000a\u000aWhatever the legal status of your medications, ''request a letter from your physician'' explaining why the drugs you are transporting have been prescribed to you. Also include over-the-counter drugs if needed.

V!Before you leave\u000a!!!!Know where you are medically before you depart\u000aRegardless of whether you have an existing medical condition, there are a few things you should do before you go abroad. Feel free to schedule an appointment with [[Vanderbilt's Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]] to talk through your situation based on your destination and the best steps for your individual wellbeing.\u000a\u000aFirst, consult with a travel medicine clinic (such as the one at the [[VU Student Health Center|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/student-health/travel-medicine]]) about any ''vaccinations'' that might be necessary or advisable. You should do this as soon as possible!\u000a\u000aMeet with your medical, dental, and other care providers for a ''full checkup''. You don't want to be blindsided by an unrecognized condition when you arrive in your new location.\u000a\u000aIf you have an existing medical or mental health condition, have an honest discussion with your care providers about your current history and ''how study abroad will fit into your care plan''. Talk with your care provider about a prescription that will last the entire duration of your program.\u000a\u000aConsult with [[Vanderbilt's Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]] to discuss how international insurance will cover any appointments or prescriptions you may require abroad. The  Office of Global Safety can also assist you in ''setting up appointments in advance'' since there can be very long wait times for appointments in high-enrollment locations and at certain times of the year.\u000a\u000aWhile you know your history, your program staff does not. In an emergency, you may not be able to relay information that is critical to your care. Please ''consider disclosing any physical or mental health conditions'' to your program staff prior to arrival. You can <<if $facultyled or $vanderbilt>>turn in a copy of the Medical Information Form from your GEO account to your faculty leader or resident director<<else>>use the program's medical history form<</if>>, or send an email detailing your history and current care plan.\u000a\u000aLearn the generic names and legal status of any ''prescription medications'' you take //before// you leave the US. In some cases, GEO may be able to advise you on whether your prescriptions are legal to carry abroad. If not, we will help direct you to the appropriate embassy to confirm this information. Contact your GEO advisor or [[Vanderbilt's Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]].\u000a\u000aEven if your medication(s) are legal, request a letter from your physician explaining your use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs to ensure that you will be allowed entry into your host country.\u000a\u000aWork with the travel clinic mental health team to ''identify resources for obtaining your prescriptions'' in your host country. Your provider may want you to obtain<<if not $shortterm>> monthly<</if>> prescriptions in the host country, and you may also need to have resources available in case you lose your medications.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Do I need any vaccinations?|Vaccinations]]\u000a   [[How do I find out more about my medications?|Where to find crucial information about your medications]]\u000a   [[Should I really disclose my medical information?|Disclosing medical information]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Medical insurance">>

V!Culture shock\u000a!!!!The process of adjusting to a new culture\u000aStudy abroad is an amazing time in the lives of students. Yet it is natural to have difficulty adjusting to a new culture. We call the feelings associated with this adaptation process "culture shock," and they take a variety of forms. These may include homesickness, sadness, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and more.\u000a\u000aCulture shock is usually not sudden or "shocking." Instead, it describes a continuum of feelings. Usually, there is a period of excitement when you first arrive--there is so much to see and do! The more negative feelings associated with culture shock, such as anxiety, frustration, or loneliness, typically come soon after. The good news is that culture shock is temporary<<if $shortterm>>, and when you are on a short-term program you may not experience it at all.<<else>>. Nearly all students will, after a few weeks, adjust to and thrive in their new surroundings.<</if>>\u000a\u000aHow long culture shock lasts and how difficult it is, of course, differs depending on the person. If you are having a hard time adjusting--especially if others on your program seem to be doing fine--reach out to your resident staff or <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>director<</if>> to describe what you are feeling.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that you will likely experience a similar adjustment period when you return home and back to Vanderbilt. Students often tell us that this "shock" is harder than going abroad. \u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[How can I cope with culture shock or other stress abroad?|Coping with stress and culture shock]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Illness abroad">>\u005c

This plan is more comprehensive than most plans and includes coverage for mandatory evacuation, preexisting conditions, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Unlike many international insurance plans, it also covers injuries that involve substance use.\u000a''Before you travel, you will receive an email from our insurance provider'', GeoBlue, with a letter and an insurance card that you can print and carry with you.\u000a\u000aYou may also be enrolled in an international health insurance by your program provider. Be sure to read your insurance benefits for all plans and know how to access health care providers in your host country. ''Know what your insurance covers'' and how to file and pay claims.\u000a\u000a''This insurance only covers you outside the United States.'' GEO strongly encourages all students to maintain health insurance in their home country. If unforeseen circumstances force you to return home, you will want to be insured.\u000a\u000aInternational health insurance usually ''only covers you for the official dates of your program.'' If you are planning to travel before or after your program begins, GEO recommends that you purchase additional short-term coverage. You are free to select any provider, but Vanderbilt's international insurance provider, [[GeoBlue|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/health-safety/#insurance]], is readily available at reasonable prices. \u000a\u000aIf you are currently under medical care, your international health insurance can help in locating an appropriate care provider in your host country.

V!Illness abroad\u000a!!!!Know attendance policies and who to contact\u000aThink about who can best help you if you are sick or injured while abroad. It will usually be someone on site, with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program's resident director or staff<</if>> at the top of the list.\u000a\u000aWhen you arrive at your program site, you should receive a list of all appropriate emergency contacts for your program<<if not $facultyled>> or host university<</if>>, as well as for emergency services (police, ambulance, etc.). If you don't receive this information, ask for it! Also consider recording it on GEO's [[handy wallet-sized card|$emergencyCardURL]].\u000a\u000aIf your program doesn't have resident staff, or if it isn't practical to reach them in an emergency, you should call ''Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel'' (VIRT). [[VIRT|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/virt]] is Vanderbilt's 24/7 emergency response service. They can help you coordinate support services and get you the help you need. If you need VIRT's help but it is not an emergency, you can email [[virt@vanderbilt.edu|mailto:virt@vanderbilt.edu]].\u000a\u000aRemember that phone numbers for emergency services will be different in each country you might visit.

V<<sidebar "Going abroad ... again!">>\u000aStudents who return from abroad often feel the need to go abroad again.\u000a\u000aIf you are not graduating and you have room in your academic schedule, you are welcome to ''apply for another GEO study abroad program''--there is no rule that says you can only go once! Or, if you are more strapped for time, consider ''volunteering abroad''. You can go over break either with a student organization such as Alternative Spring Break, or by seeking out an external organization. You may even be able to find funding (ask the Office of Immersion Resources about the [[Nichols Humanitarian Fund|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/nicholsfund/]]).\u000a\u000aOr consider ''graduate studies abroad''. Several universities around the world welcome international students for graduate degrees. Many have more reasonable tuition fees than you will find in the US, yet with comparable educational quality and prestige. It is often possible to apply US federal financial aid toward studies at recognized institutions. Some countries, like the United Kingdom, will even give you a one- or two-year work visa upon completion of an advanced degree in their country.\u000a\u000aAnother option might be ''working or interning abroad'', including teaching English abroad. Visit the [[Career Center|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/career/]] for resources and tips for finding an international job, or consult with our sister office the [[English Language Center|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/elc/]] if you are interested in teaching English overseas.\u000a\u000a<<segue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

You can also get involved in our own local community: you may be surprised how international Nashville really is!\u000a\u000aStudying abroad can make you a great candidate for ''prestigious honors scholarships'' when you return home. Some of these, such as the Fulbright Fellowship or Critical Language Summer Institutes, may even send you abroad again.

V!Reverse culture shock\u000a!!!!Be prepared for coming home to be a bumpy ride\u000aIt may seem like a distant reality now, but part of the study abroad experience is returning home. Many students tell GEO that this is harder than expected, and often harder than going abroad to begin with!\u000a\u000aLook, [[reverse culture shock|https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/tc/c56075.htm]] is a fact. Returning home after a significant period of time abroad is in some ways just like going abroad. You have changed, your perceptions have changed, and you are now used to living in and interacting with a different culture. You may even find that readjusting to life in the US is more difficult than the initial adaption to your host country. Instead of ignoring this reverse culture shock, learn about effective ways to combat it. Rest assured, there are many resources that may be helpful as you make the adjustment to being back at home. We have listed some of them below.\u000a\u000aSome students benefit from supportive counseling when struggling with reverse culture shock. You can contact [[Vanderbilt's University Counseling Center|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/]] for counseling services at no charge.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources for Reverse Culture Shock|\u000a|[[Top 10 Challenges Faced on Returning from Study Abroad|https://abroad.du.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=594]]|\u000a|[[Common Challenges and Coping Strategies|https://abroad.du.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=596]]|\u000a|[[Tips for Family and Friends on Welcoming a Student Home|https://abroad.du.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=599]]|\u000a|[[Small Planet Studio, an online community for study abroad alums|http://www.smallplanetstudio.com/]]|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's University Counseling Center|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Opportunities for returned students">>\u005c

V!GEO's annual Photo Contest\u000a!!!!Keep the contest in mind as you decide what to photograph!\u000aEvery year, GEO conducts a photo contest. We solicit photos on a rolling basis from students who are studying abroad during the current academic year. Photos will be judged in the summer, and winners will receive an Amazon gift card! We put the winning photos on live exhibit on campus, and they tend to show up in campus publications as well, including //Vanderbilt Magazine.//\u000a\u000aCheck out last year\u2019s winning photos and submit your photos at [[our website|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/geo/photo-contest/]].\u000a\u000aPhotos can be of any subject (scenery, activities, cultures, etc.) but please be tasteful and respectful as you snap your pics.\u000a\u000aGEO is particularly keen on photos that show Vanderbilt students participating in academic and cultural endeavors. Scenery is beautiful, but action shots with Vandy representatives (such as yourself) tell interesting stories!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Quick guidelines for ethical photography|Ethical photography]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Register your participation">>\u005c

V!Preparation and responsibilities\u000a!!!!Getting ready and seizing opportunities\u000aThere are many things that you need to do to prepare to go abroad. <<if not ($summer or $maymester)>>What should you do about your on-campus housing? Your meal plan? Your Commodore Card? What if you would like to pursue additional funding?\u000a\u000a<</if>>GEO can't help you manage everything, of course, but we have put together a checklist of things to do not only before you leave, but also while you're abroad and after you return to the US. (Later in this presentation, we'll also discuss tips for packing, getting a passport/visa, traveling with prescription drugs, and other topics.)\u000a\u000aIn addition to responsibilities, the checklist also highlights opportunities you can prepare for or take advantage of while you are abroad.

V!Making friends\u000a!!!!Consider your goals as well as your opportunities\u000aStarting off in a foreign country is in some ways like being a first-year student again. //Everything// is new, including all or most of the other students. Most study abroad programs offer orientation activities at the beginning of the term. Take advantage of social opportunities during this orientation. It's your best chance to get to know the other participants, and it's not hard--luckily, they happen to be in the market for new friends too!\u000a\u000aWhile it will be great to have friends in your program, you should be aware of the disadvantages of spending too much time with US-based students. If your goals include meeting local people, learning the language, or becoming something more than a long-stay tourist, you will need to look beyond the study abroad crowd.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Meeting local people">>\u005c

V!Meeting local people\u000a!!!!Get involved--outside your comfort zone\u000aGEO strongly encourages our students to get to know local people and students in more than superficial ways. Not only does this provide the greatest opportunities for building cross-cultural and language skills, it will also give you a more meaningful experience. <<if $facultyled or $shortterm>>\u000a\u000aWhile your opportunities may be limited by the short duration and intense schedule of your program, you can still enrich your experience by making some efforts.<<else>>Still, getting to know locals can seem daunting.<</if>> Here are some tips.\u000a\u000a<<if $facultyled>>Start by chatting with your ''faculty leader''. Let them know of your interest in the local culture, and you will probably get some tips that are well-tailored to the particular opportunities available on your program.\u000a\u000a<</if>><<if not $facultyled and not $shortterm>><<if $summer>>Your program may <<else>>In many countries, your visa or residence permit will <</if>>allow you to ''volunteer'' in the community or even do an ''internship'': fantastic ways to immerse yourself in the local culture while also beefing up your resume. If you have questions about whether you can volunteer<<if not $summer>> in your country<</if>>, [[contact GEO|https://vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising/]] or your program provider.\u000a\u000a<</if>>If you will be living with a ''host family'', explore the opportunities provided by their wider social network. They likely know people that you might like to get to know!\u000a\u000a<<if not $shortterm>>If you are enrolled in or taking classes at a university, join ''student organizations'' on campus. Your campus probably has many clubs and intramural sports, and joining up is a great way to find locals who share your interests.\u000a\u000a<</if>><<if not $facultyled>>Visit your university's ''office of international student services''. In addition to local knowledge about bus routes and student discounts, they may offer inexpensive excursions and other social opportunities.\u000a\u000a<</if>>Most important, ''put yourself out there!'' It may be uncomfortable at first, but it will pay off in the long run. And of course, ''be safe''!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Homestays">>\u000a   [[Gifts and relationships|Gifts and relationships]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Reverse culture shock">>\u000a

V<<sidebar "Gifts and relationships">>\u000aPresenting a gift shows that you value a relationship--even a new one. Consider a gift to start off your more important relationships abroad, such as with your homestay family or a host-country roommate.\u000a\u000aIn a cross-cultural setting, the best gifts can be those that let you bring a little of where you're from to the relationship. Examples might include a Vanderbilt mug or pendant, a photo book about Nashville or your hometown, maple syrup if you're from Vermont, or maybe biscuit or grits mix if you're from the South. Not only are gifts like these polite, positive, well-meaning gestures, they can also spur conversations ("Is an American biscuit the same thing as a scone?").\u000a\u000aPhotos of home are another great conversation starter. Make sure you bring along some photos of your family, your house, your campus, your hobbies, and so on. It's a great way for people to feel like they are getting to know you and where you come from. \u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Academic systems abroad">>\u000a<<if $facultyled>>Thinking about spending a semester overseas? Read below to learn more about academic systems abroad, and how they might differ from what you're used to in the US.<<else>>Higher education and academic systems abroad can vary greatly from what you are used to in the United States. Here are some things that might be different depending on the country. Talk to your GEO advisor to find out more about what you might encounter on your program.<</if>>\u000a\u000a!!!!!!Potential differences in academic systems abroad\u000a*There may be fewer hours spent in the classroom, with students expected to spend more time studying on their own. This doesn't mean that there will be assigned homework! A lot of responsibility for deciding how best to spend your homework hours may be left up to you.\u000a*Depending on the course and level you are taking, and whether you are taking it in a foreign language, you may need to spend extra time learning and mastering the material.\u000a*There may be fewer tests and quizzes, and students may earn a grade based on just one final exam, or a mid-term and a final. You may have little opportunity to gauge how a professor grades in the weeks or months before an exam.\u000a*Professors may be less accessible for office hours and by email.\u000a*Classes may be more lecture-style than discussion-based. This may leave fewer opportunities to ask questions or express your opinions.\u000a*There may not be much sense of privacy attached to grades. For example, the instructor might post all exam grades publicly. In some places, individual grades may be discussed openly in class.\u000a*The prevailing academic culture may be very different. For example, students may not be as concerned--or concerned at all--about getting high grade point averages.\u000a*In some places, such as Spain and Latin America, students pursue something like a strict professional degree, without a liberal arts component. They will have had a much more focused academic experience than you and your US-educated peers.\u000a*Students likely do not live on campus, which may mean that you need to meet people through academics at first, or by joining a club or other activity.<<if not $facultyled>>\u000a<hr>//Every country is different!

V!Identity and diversity\u000a!!!!Research beliefs, attitudes, and experiences\u000aOur surroundings shape us and help to define who we are. <<if $shortterm>>Experiencing<<else>>Living in<</if>> another cultural context will give you the chance to explore many facets of your identity, and to do so in light of new surroundings. Students overwhelmingly tell us that this process leads to increased personal growth and insight. However, it often carries difficulties too.\u000a\u000aAs you gear up for your time abroad, prepare yourself for how people in your new culture will perceive you. Just as in the US, people abroad will have beliefs, myths, stereotypes, and prejudices about aspects of personal identity. You may also find that the way(s) in which you identify yourself in the US differ from how others will identify you abroad.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!You might be surprised to learn...|\u000a|No matter what their background, the components of identity that most impact the experience of students abroad are ''nationality'' and ''gender''.|\u000a\u000aResearch the viewpoints held by people of your host country, including beliefs, laws, and customs that revolve around nationality, race and ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, mobility, and more. You may be able to prevent or at least alleviate cultural misunderstandings by learning as much as you can about your host culture before leaving. But also prepare for how your time abroad might change, challenge, and strengthen your own identity.\u000a\u000aWe encourage //all// students to read all of the information linked below.

V<<sidebar "Race and ethnicity abroad">>\u000aDepending on who you are and where you are going, you may feel a part of a racial or ethnic majority for the first time in your life. Or you may have the opposite experience, becoming an ethnic minority in one fell swoop. Either way, you will likely find that your ethnic or racial identity has different implications in your new host country than it has at home. \u000a\u000aThese new vantage points on self and identity can be exciting, but they can also be difficult. People may consistently misidentify you based on physical appearance, for example. Or you may be surprised at how freely people comment on appearance. If your appearance is very exotic for your host culture, you may find that you are stared at, or that people want to touch your hair or skin.\u000a\u000aOr, it's possible that your physical appearance and racial or ethnic identity is almost totally ignored, and all that really seems to matter is your nationality or gender.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling to a location that is part of your own heritage, be aware that people there may not see your heritage as the most important thing about you. If you are from the US, you may find that people there identify you as an American first. You should be prepared to be considered an outsider.   \u000a\u000aFor all of these reasons, it will be wise to prepare yourself in advance for the attitudes on race and ethnicity held by people of your host country.

V<<sidebar "Sexual and gender identity abroad">>\u000aIf you identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, or intersex, you will want to take time to consider whether and how you plan to be out abroad. Depending on where you are traveling, your destination may provide you with either a more open environment than the US, or a much less welcoming one. Either way, be prepared: make yourself aware in advance of local attitudes, beliefs, and understandings. Ask yourself questions like the following:\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions for LGBTQI Students to Consider:|\u000a|What behaviors are legal in my host country? If I am interested in activism, are there ways to practice it both safely and legally?|\u000a|<hr>Is it safe for me to be out in my host country and city?|\u000a|<hr>How open do I want or need to be about my gender or sexual identity while abroad? Do I plan to be out? How specifically will I reconcile my human rights with the cultural values of my host country?|\u000a|<hr>If my destination is one where I need to conceal my identity, how will this impact my experience?|\u000a|<hr>What are the cultural norms surrounding friendship and dating in my host culture?|\u000a|<hr>What norms surround publicly identifying as LGBTQI in my host culture? How does my self-presentation "read" in my host culture's system of gendered norms and expectations?|\u000a|<hr>What is the LGBTQI community in my host city like? How is it different from the community at home?|\u000a|<hr>What on-site resources will I have if I experience any issues/concerns while I am abroad? Are there LGBTQI organizations or other resources at my host university or in my host city?|\u000a|<hr>Do I have concerns about my housing situation? (If living with a host family, consider making the housing coordinator aware that you would like a host family that has hosted LGBTQI students in the past.)|\u000a|<hr>Might I face challenges with travel and documents due to my gender presentation?|\u000a\u000aRegardless of self-identification, all students should be aware not only of local attitudes and beliefs surrounding sex and sexual identity, but also of local laws. Some countries criminalize speech as well as behavior, and you need to be well informed about matters that could affect your safety and well-being. The [[ILGA website|http://ilga.org/]] is a good resource for checking on legal regimes around the world. \u000a\u000aStudy abroad is often a time when students explore identity and selfhood. If you are not out at home and are considering being out abroad, please make doubly sure that you do your research and ensure that your safety and well-being are provided for. If you will live with a homestay family and want to be out to them, consider telling the housing coordinator in advance that you would like an LGBTQI-friendly family. You can stipulate that they keep your request confidential, including from the family.\u000a\u000aThe local LGBTQI community will likely be quite different from that in your home country. Coming to know and understand this new culture will likely be exciting and rewarding, but like any process of cultural adaptation it may also be trying at times. Learn as much as you can in advance, but also adopt the attitude that difficulties are challenges to overcome rather than merely obstacles in your way.\u000a\u000aIt may be helpful to talk with others who have studied or traveled in your host country. You may be able to take advantage of welcoming contexts on campus, such as the [[Office of LGBTQI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], to help you network with past participants. Your study abroad provider may be able to connect you with LGBTQI alumni of your specific program. Your program staff can also serve as an excellent resource both before you leave and while you're abroad.\u000a\u000aIf you would like to talk about any aspect of your program with the Global Education Office, please do not hesitate to [[contact us|https://vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising/]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|Vanderbilt's [[Office of LGBTQI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], a cultural center and resource for information and support about gender and sexuality|\u000a|[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|http://ilga.org/]] provides legal information on every country, as well as news and reports on the state of LGBTQI rights around the world|\u000a|[[Outright Action International|https://www.outrightinternational.org/documentation/reports]] has extensive country-specific resources.|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG bibliography|https://overseas.iu.edu/planning/expectations/SIG-bibliography.html]], bibliography of LGBTQI literature with an international perspective|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG|http://www.rainbowsig.org/resource-center/study-abroad/]], an organization of study abroad professionals knowledgeable about LGBTQI issues|\u000a|[[ILGA-Europe|http://www.ilga-europe.org/]], the website of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's European chapter, provides multiple resources, including a Guide to Europe|\u000a|[[Utopia|http://www.utopia-asia.com/]], an online guide to Asia-Pacific gay and lesbian resources, including legal and cultural information as well as links to country-specific resources|\u000a|[[US passport requirements|https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/gender.html]] for transgender students|\u000a|[[GEO's Global Safety and Security Manager|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising#safetyadvising]], for personal guidance on safety and wellbeing for all travelers|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Gender roles abroad">>\u000aExpectations surrounding gender roles vary from country to country, and even within countries. Because so much of our communication with others is interpreted in terms of gender, it is helpful to learn something about gender roles in your host culture. One of the best things about study abroad is making new friends, and you will want to avoid undue friction due to misunderstanding and miscommunication.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Things to think about include:|\u000a|Americans are accustomed to having non-romantic friendships with the opposite sex.

What might your manner of dress communicate to them about you?|\u000a\u000aWhile men studying abroad will certainly see cultural differences in their ascribed roles, it is women who will usually need to adapt most to local norms and values. North American women should be aware that they may face special sets of attitudes and assumptions.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Women may want to further research questions like these:|\u000a|In some countries, catcalls or other forms of harassment of women might be common. Is this sort of thing likely in your host country? How will you deal with it if so?|\u000a|<hr>Are there stereotypes about North American women in particular? In many places, women from the US and Canada may be seen as "easy" or out for sexual adventure.|\u000a|<hr>What behaviors might be construed as sexual? Smiling or greeting strangers? Looking directly at others? Going out at night without a companion of the opposite sex?|\u000a\u000aIt can be useful to talk with [[study abroad alumni|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising#alumni]] of your host country about what they've experienced.

V<<sidebar "Religious identity abroad">>\u000aReligion is a prominent feature of cultures around the world, even in countries that are officially atheist. During your time abroad, you will likely encounter fascinating and enriching ideas and practices. You may also experience things that challenge your notions of spiritual truth or even basic fairness. \u000a\u000aIf you plan to practice your own religion abroad, do some research first. You'll want to know whether there are convenient houses of worship, of course. But depending on where you are going, there may be safety issues to consider as well.\u000a\u000aIn some countries, there may be little commitment to religious pluralism. The state may sanction a religion. Or laws may restrict religious speech, particularly as it relates to political activism. In China, for example, it is a violation of the state constitution to use religion to "disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state."\u000a\u000aEven if the society is generally an open one, be aware that safety concerns may still exist. Just as in the US, wearing symbols of some religions or frequenting houses of worship may make you a target for passionate violence from other groups. \u000a\u000aWhatever your personal beliefs and circumstances, remember that your primary purpose is studying abroad. Consider your experiences an opportunity to understand the historical and social dimensions of religion in your host country. Be open-minded, save critical impulses for later, and open your own beliefs and practices to the same degree of scrutiny. If you approach your time in your host country as a time to learn about others' beliefs and attitudes, you can avoid many opportunities for conflict.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself|\u000a|Is there a dominant religion in my host country?|\u000a|<hr>What laws exist pertaining to religion?

V<<sidebar "Being American abroad">>\u000aIf you grew up in the US and identify as American, your American-ness will probably be the most important factor in how natives of your host country relate to you. (This is true no matter what your background.) While other components of your identity may be important factors, the fact that you are American will be a critical component of your identity abroad.\u000a\u000aBe prepared to encounter curiosity and interest. America's unique economic, political, and cultural position in the world means that people all around the world feel like they have a stake in what the US does. You may be asked all sorts of questions, from what it's like to live in America to what you think of politics and other issues in the US. (The FBI has recently warned that American students abroad may also be the target of espionage recruitment.)\u000a\u000aMost interest you receive will probably be friendly, even if frankly or passionately expressed. But do prepare yourself to encounter actual hostility as well, and to consider how you might handle it.\u000a\u000aIn many places, people may assume that because you are American, you are also rich. Or they may have other assumptions, based on media portrayals, local history with US policies or intervention, or other sources. Do some research before you go so that you can have some idea of what being an American might mean in your host country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Quick tip|\u000a|In some parts of the world, you should be careful about referring to yourself as "American."

These cards offer more secure transactions by adding an embedded microchip and replacing easily forged signatures with entry of a PIN number.\u000a\u000aWhile US cards all now have chips, a small proportion of overseas processing machines may not be compatible with the US version of the technology. To maximize payment convenience, ''learn the PIN numbers for any credit cards //and// debit cards'' you bring with you.\u000a\u000a''Self-service kiosks are the main culprit for difficulties,'' and may not work even if you do know your US-issued card\u2019s PIN. If you are traveling via train or bus, plan to arrive a little early so that you can find a cashier if need be, and carry cash as well so that you have an alternate form of payment if required. Other places self-service machines might be required are at luggage lockers, bike-rental kiosks, highway tolls, etc.\u000a\u000aIf you are using a credit card, be sure that you are making a simple payment rather than a cash advance. Cash advances can result in high transaction and interest payments.\u000a\u000aYou may want to ''shop around for banks and credit cards'' before you leave.

V<<sidebar "Coping with stress & culture shock">>\u000aCulture shock is one expression of stress, but even after culture shock passes, living and studying abroad may sometimes be stressful. Stress may be harder to manage when you are far from your normal support group of family and friends. Learn to recognize the signs of stress and take steps to cope with the situation and make yourself more resilient.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|>|>|Common signs of stress|h\u000a|exhaustion|fatigue|change in appetite|\u000a|anxiety|isolation|alienation|\u000a|frustration|extreme homesickness|increased use of nicotine, alcohol, or drugs|\u000a|loneliness|change in behavior|self-harming|\u000a|>|>|new or more frequent physical symptoms, e.g. headaches, stomachaches, etc.|\u000a\u000aOne of the best ways to combat stress in a new environment is to prepare for the new location. ''Learn as much as you can about your host city'' before you go. Read up on climate, foods, politics, culture, religion, and more. Buy a phrasebook and try to learn some of the basics of the language.\u000a\u000a''Take a step back.'' Analyze your situation and study your own reactions. Where exactly is the stress coming from? Ask yourself if cultural differences might be a contributing factor, and how you can work with or around them. Focus on what you can change or control, not on what you can't: If you can't change the situation, work on changing your reactions to it.\u000a\u000a''Take care of your body.'' Be sure that you are staying active, eating well, and getting enough sleep. Work on being positive, and be active--get out of your room.\u000a\u000a''Identify what helps you //healthfully// manage stress.'' Avoid using pills, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, overeating, undereating, or oversleeping to manage stress. Instead, focus on healthy antidotes and find the ones that work for you.

V!Eating and diet\u000a!!!!Balancing diet and safety with cultural exploration\u000aPeople everywhere eat differently because they //are// different--they have different cultures. Exploring another culture means exploring its food. GEO recommends that you keep an open mind, accept cultural differences, and try everything you (safely) can. Have a gastronomic adventure!\u000a\u000aBe sure to eat safely, however. Travelers diarrhea and, worse, food poisoning are no fun. You can never eliminate the risk of ''food-borne illness'' entirely, but you can learn more about your destination to make safer choices about your food and drink. The CDC provides [[country-specific safer eating guidelines|https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/]], and we encourage you to check out all the destinations on your itinerary. If you do get a food-borne illness, drink fluids to stay hydrated, and consider taking over-the-counter medications to keep diarrhea under control. Seek medical attention if your symptoms are serious or prolonged. [[General tips and information about food safety|https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Food-safety-while-travelling]]\u000a\u000aIf you have dietary restrictions, eating well while fully experiencing your host culture may be a challenge. Whether you maintain your diet for medical, religious, philosophical, or other reasons, be sure to ''share the details with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program staff<</if>> //before// you arrive on site.'' They will use this information to help identify appropriate housing/dining for you. They //may// also be able to research restaurants, grocery stores, and useful vocabulary.\u000a\u000a''If you have a food allergy, be very detailed in disclosing what is safe for you''.  For example, if you have a nut allergy, can you be around nuts? can you eat food processed on the same equipment as nuts? are all nuts harmful for you? Let your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader, other staff, and your classmates<<else>>program and host family<</if>> know.\u000a\u000a''Learn as much as you can about your host culture's food, food culture, and food vocabulary before you go''. Your diet and the terms you use for it may not be well understood there, so be prepared to explain why you can\u2019t, or choose not to, eat certain foods--ideally before someone cooks you a meal.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Travel destination advice|https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/]], country-specific travel advice from the Centers for Disease Control|\u000a|[[Food safety while traveling|https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Food-safety-while-travelling]], an information-rich resource|\u000a|[[International Vegetarian Union|http://www.ivu.org/]], information and recipes for vegetarians and vegans worldwide|\u000a|[[HappyCow|https://www.happycow.net/]], a searchable guide to vegetarian restaurants worldwide|\u000a|[[SelectWisely|http://www.selectwisely.com/Resources/]], a library of links to information about traveling abroad with dietary restrictions|\u000a|[[Jewish Travel Advisor|http://jewishtraveladvisor.com/]], world-wide listing of kosher hotels and restaurants, synagogues, mikvaot, and Jewish communities around the world |\u000a|[[Halal Trip|http://www.halaltrip.com/city-guide-all]], website focused on Muslim travelers and including city guides with a focus on halal dining|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Making friends">>\u005c

V!Preparing for safety\u000a!!!!Research your destination and register your travel\u000a<div class="talkbox">\u000a|box|k\u000a|!COVID-19 Considerations|\u000a|The ''coronavirus epidemic continues to present challenges worldwide''. Your program will provide operating procedures, guidelines, and updates while you are abroad. It is critical that you heed this advice and adhere to your program's policies as well as your locality's requirements. Disciplinary action from your program and legal action from local authorities are real possibilities.|\u000a|Most countries outside the United States have taken more nationalized and often more stringent approaches to COVID-19 measures. You are likely to find somewhat different COVID rules and more nuance in how those are applied. In particular, ''response to COVID outbreaks is more likely to involve strict, if temporary, lockdowns and targeted shutdown of services''. These may cause inconvenience, including interrupting classes or travel. It is possible that your coursework might need to go online for an extended period, or that a planned trip may have to be canceled.|\u000a|Requirements and restrictions imposed by the US government, foreign governments, regional governments, airlines, or other entities may change at any time. ''You are ultimately responsible for being aware of and taking action'' to ensure that you meet all these requirements.|\u000a|Students who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 may face additional obstacles such as, for example, the requirement to undergo regular testing in order to participate in many activities. ''Governments may not recognize all types of COVID vaccines as fulfilling requirements''--be sure to check whether your vaccine is recognized. Also check whether your proof of vaccination (CDC card, etc.) will be accepted by all countries you hope to spend time in.|\u000a|It is possible that ''governments may impose vaccination (or other) requirements'', including booster shots, at any time.|\u000a</div>\u000aWhile generally not more dangerous than life in Nashville, study abroad is not a risk-free activity. You are traveling into an unfamiliar country and situation, and the most effective way to avoid problems is to plug the gaps in your knowledge.\u000a\u000aThe more you know and learn about your destination before you go, the safer you will be. Read all the program information you are given, attend the Office of Global Safety's orientation (see below), and do your own research as well. Up-to-date commercial guidebooks are often good resources, particularly for coverage of local risks and high-crime areas. Country-specific information provided by the US Department of State and its counterparts overseas can also be helpful.\u000a\u000aKnow the local laws, and learn about behavioral norms and expectations. Outspokenness and ostentatious public behavior are not virtues in most places abroad. In some situations they may invite unwanted attention and problems. Dress in a fashion that is appropriate to cultural norms and religious sensitivities.\u000a\u000aYour main destination will be automatically registered with  Vanderbilt's emergency evacuation provider (Anvil Group).\u000a\u000aIf you are a US citizen, also ''register with the Department of State's [[STEP program|https://step.state.gov/step/]]'', which allows the US Embassy in your host country to contact you with updates, both before, during, and after an emergency. \u000a\u000a''If you are not a US citizen,'' you can still utilize publicly available resources from the US Department of State, such as online updates. You can also seek out comparable resources from your home country. If your home country has an embassy or consulate near your study abroad site, we recommend that you make note of the contact information.\u000a\u000aFinally, be sure to enter the phone number for Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT) into your mobile phone: ''+1 615-322-2745''. VIRT provides round-the-clock health and safety assistance to Vanderbilt community members around the world.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Global Safety Pre-Departure Session|\u000a|''Date and time to be determined''|\u000a| Via Zoom |\u000a|This is a mandatory session with the Office of Global Safety, and you will need to attend in order to maintain eligibility to study abroad.

V!Basic safety abroad\u000a!!!!Tips for staying safe while out and about\u000aYou are the best guarantor of your own safety! While abroad, commit yourself to being an alert and observant traveler at all times. Anticipate problems by learning to read the local environment, and by knowing where and when to be hypervigilant. If you aren't paying attention, you can easily become the victim of opportunistic crime.\u000a\u000aRoad safety issues and driving accidents are the //primary// cause of injury to students abroad. Learn local traffic patterns and traffic laws, as well as safe pedestrian habits. Given the risks of traffic accidents, ''Vanderbilt does //not// recommend the rental of motor vehicles while studying abroad''.\u000a\u000a''Know where you are going and look like you belong''. Definitely bring your map along, but don't check it in the open street, where looking lost could get you robbed. Be friendly, but don't hesitate to refuse offers of help from strangers, especially near ATMs, ticket machines, train and metro stations, and baggage lines. See a [[list of common travel scams|http://www.justtheflight.co.uk/blog/16-40-tourist-scams-to-avoid-this-summer.html]].\u000a\u000a''Avoid demonstrations and political disturbances'' of all kinds. Large gatherings of any kind are an increased risk, as crowd behavior is unpredictable and even peaceful marches can turn violent. \u000a\u000a''Get a working cell phone'' and carry it with you. Some programs require students to have a phone, and most will provide you information on getting a cheap phone that works locally. A phone can be a literal lifeline in an emergency--carry one! There is more information on phones abroad later in this guide.\u000a\u000aSecure your travel and identification documents at all times, and store duplicate copies in multiple places. ''Know your local emergency numbers'', particularly for your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director and program staff<</if>>, and for the [[local equivalent of 911|$local911URL]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|Vanderbilt's [[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]], for personal guidance on health and wellness as well as personalized safety guidance for all travelers|\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Road safety overseas|Road safety overseas]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Alcohol and drugs">>\u005c

V!Personal emergencies\u000a!!!!What to do after experiencing a personal emergency\u000aPersonal emergencies may arise from illness, accidents, behavioral health crises, or criminal/negligent behavior. They generally require immediate assistance, whether from a health professional, law enforcement, a counselor, or some combination of these. If you encounter a personal emergency abroad, follow these steps:\u000a\u000a''Request help immediately''. Know the local [[emergency number or numbers|$local911URL]] (911 doesn't work abroad!) and have your phone with you at all times. You may download GEO's [[wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|$emergencyCardURL]] to record information in a handy, portable format.\u000a\u000a''Notify your program's emergency contact''. <<if $facultyled>>Your faculty leader or another designated person <<else>>On most programs, at least one member of your program's staff <</if>>will be available to you around the clock. On-site personnel are best positioned to provide timely and appropriate emergency support. If you are reporting an emergency on behalf of a friend, be sure to identify yourself as well as your friend.\u000a\u000aIf you are in immediate danger, ''contact law enforcement as soon as possible''. If you are considering reporting something less immediate to law enforcement, contact your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader or other designated contact <<else>>program staff <</if>>first. They may be in a better position to talk with law enforcement<<if not $facultyled>>, and will also know the proper protocols<</if>>. Work with them if at all possible. If you do not have access to resident program staff, contact Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT) at +1 615-322-2745.\u000a\u000a''Contact your insurance provider'' if the emergency requires medical attention of any kind. This may be Vanderbilt's international health insurance provider (GeoBlue) or a provider utilized by your program abroad.\u000a\u000a''Notify Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel'' (VIRT). [[VIRT|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/virt]] is Vanderbilt's 24/7 emergency response service. They can help you coordinate support services and get you the help you need.\u000a\u000a''Contact the nearest embassy''. Consular agents at US embassies are available 24/7 to help US citizens with emergencies. If you are not a US citizen, contact both the US embassy (tell them you are a student at a US university) and your home country's embassy.\u000a\u000a''Contact your family''. Your family will be anxious and concerned about your well-being. Your program staff <<if not $facultyled>>and GEO are both<<else>>are<</if>> limited in the information they can share, so be sure to communicate with your family directly if you can.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Large-scale emergencies">>\u005c

V!Large-scale emergencies\u000a!!!!Procedures for dealing with large-scale disasters\u000aLarge-scale emergencies take many forms. Massive accidents, civil strife, acts of terrorism, natural disasters.... They are hard to predict and proper response depends heavily on local circumstances. \u000a\u000aIn general, your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program staff<</if>> will brief you soon after arrival on emergency protocols. (If they don't, take responsibility for your own safety and ask them!) Local emergency plans typically include the following elements:\u005c\u000a\u000a*a pre-established location where students and staff will assemble after a large-scale disaster;\u000a*communications protocols designed to account for all program participants;\u000a*an evacuation plan;\u000a*contingency plans short of full evacuation.\u005c\u000a\u000aThe most important general advice that Vanderbilt can offer is this: ''Know the protocols of your <<if $facultyled>>program's<<else>>site's<</if>> emergency plan.'' Keep calm, follow those protocols, and act with common sense and your best knowledge of the local situation.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling independently or are unable to reach your rally point, ''contact Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel'' (VIRT) at +1 615-322-2745.

V<<sidebar "Road safety overseas">>\u000aMovies and media reporting have conditioned us to think that the greatest threats to safety abroad are dramatic, "foreign," and of the "third world." The reality is that the ''number one cause of injury and death for American students abroad is traffic accidents''. And the vast majority of these occur in wealthy, industrialized countries.\u000a\u000aGEO suggests that you train yourself to pay maximum attention at all times. Whether walking or driving, avoid earbuds or looking at your phone. These distractions, as well as drinking, can all impair perception! Know the basic patterns of traffic in your host city, and remember to pay attention to the right side of the road in countries where traffic flow is reversed!\u000a\u000aAvoid traveling late at night, and always choose the safest form of transportation available. If you have a choice between riding in a taxicab or on the roof of a crowded bus--choose the cab! If walking is your safest option, do that whenever possible.\u000a\u000aJust as in the US, you should always wear a seatbelt. Avoid riding with anyone who appears intoxicated, over-tired, or emotionally distraught. Always sit in the back seat of a taxi.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries may present other risks, including shady taxi drivers, unsafe vehicles, overcrowded transport, and more. Your program staff will provide you with information about your options and help you assess risk. Don't be afraid to ask questions! \u000a\u000a''Vanderbilt strongly advises against renting a vehicle while abroad.'' Cars, SUVs, motorcycles, and mopeds are equally poor choices. The risks of driving when the rules of the road are unfamiliar are just too great. If you do decide that you want to drive while you're abroad, be sure to look into requirements such as international driving permits and ensure that you are appropriately insured--your US insurance likely doesn't cover you (at least not fully) abroad.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Road Safety Overseas|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html]], US Department of State|\u000a|[[Country-specific information from US Department of State|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html]], includes information on road safety for every country in the world|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Alcohol and drugs">>\u005c

V!Alcohol and drugs\u000a!!!!Intoxication is a major contributor to injury abroad\u000aVanderbilt recommends that you avoid the use of alcohol and controlled substances while overseas, even if you are of legal age. Intoxication is a major factor in injuries and deaths experienced by students abroad. Physical and mental impairment also make it difficult for you to take precautions for your own safety and well-being.\u000a\u000aIf you do drink, do so in moderation. Be careful what you consume, and always watch your drink to avoid having it spiked with a dangerous substance. \u000a\u000aRemember that your behavior is subject to local laws, to policies set by your program provider and/or university, //and// to [[Vanderbilt policy|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcoholic-beverage-and-controlled-substances-policies/]]. Laws governing controlled substances may differ greatly from those in your home country, and it is your responsibility to be aware. Public intoxication is always inappropriate, may be illegal, and can lead to serious--even fatal--consequences.\u000a\u000aIf you are uncertain about specific policies or laws abroad, please consult with a local program representative. GEO staff can also help you clarify policies.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Can I be arrested abroad?|Your legal status in your host country]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Center for Student Wellbeing|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/healthydores/]] provides information, resources, and referrals|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt University Counseling Center|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/]], available for counseling, assessment, and treatment during and after your stay abroad|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]], for personal guidance on health and wellness as well as personalized safety guidance for all travelers|\u000a|[[Alcoholics Anonymous international meeting resources|http://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/find-local-aa/world/1]]|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Student Handbook Alcohol Policy|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcoholic-beverage-and-controlled-substances-policies/]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Personal emergencies">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Your legal status in your host country">>\u000aMany US citizens are under the impression that their US passport acts as a "get out of jail free" card overseas. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever your nationality, if you are arrested, you will be subject to the entire foreign legal process--including imprisonment. Neither Vanderbilt or your government can do anything to get you out of prison!\u000a\u000aKnow the laws of your host country! Be aware that conditions in foreign jails and prisons may be very different from those in your home country. The legal system will also be difficult to understand and navigate. Your home country's consular officials can provide a wide array of services, but they //cannot extricate you from the situation//.\u000a\u000aDrug arrests can be particularly bad in many places. Harsh sentences, no bail, and dire conditions characterize many countries. Know the local laws and think twice before making a jail stay part of your time abroad. Do not carry packages or baggage for anyone else, and keep your own baggage under observation while traveling. If illegal substances are found in your bags, //you// will pay the price.\u000a\u000aIf you are arrested, your embassy cannot hire legal counsel or pay your fines or legal fees. They can only notify your family, provide you with information, and ask that you be treated humanely and according to local laws.\u000a\u000a''Should you be arrested abroad'', contact Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT) at +1 615-322-2745 and tell the VU Public Safety dispatcher that you need to report an issue to VIRT.

V!Sexual misconduct abroad\u000a!!!!Regardless of local law, Vanderbilt policies apply\u000aSocial norms--and civil and criminal laws--vary from country to country.  Even so, Vanderbilt\u2019s policies, including the university\u2019s Student Accountability and Sexual Misconduct and Intimate Partner Violence policies, apply in all study abroad programs in which Vanderbilt students participate, whether those programs are administered by Vanderbilt or a third party.  Vanderbilt students, faculty and staff participating in study abroad programs must comply with local laws, the rules and regulations of their study abroad program, and with Vanderbilt\u2019s policies.\u000a\u000aIf you are a victim of sexual misconduct while abroad, contact the <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director<</if>> of your program for help. If you are unable or unwilling to discuss the issue with program staff, please contact [[Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT)|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/virt/]], Vanderbilt's [[Title IX Office|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/title-ix/]] or [[Project Safe|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/]]. Project Safe has someone available around the clock every day of the year. The Student Handbook\u2019s [[policy on Sexual Misconduct|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]] identifies confidential resources (see also [[Project Safe|https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/133/2013/11/11204527/Resource_List_2020_2021.pdf]]).\u000a\u000aNot all countries offer the same legal protections for victims as are offered in the United States. Again, Vanderbilt can explain your options ''before you file a formal police report''. Contact VIRT/Office of Global Safety, Title IX, or Project Safe; the Student Handbook\u2019s [[policy on Sexual Misconduct|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]] identifies confidential resources (see also [[Project Safe|https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/133/2013/11/11204527/Resource_List_2020_2021.pdf]]).\u000a\u000aThe range of sanctions for violations of Vanderbilt\u2019s Student Accountability and Sexual Misconduct and Intimate Partner Violence Policies are set forth in the Student Handbook. Individuals who engage in gender-based or sexual misconduct--or other forms of misconduct--may also be subject to local laws, and the civil and criminal consequences may be severe.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[VU Student Accountability Policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/student-conduct/]], from the Student Handbook|\u000a|[[Sexual Misconduct and Intimate Partner Violence Policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]], from the Student Handbook|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Incident Response for Travel (VIRT)|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/virt/]]|\u000a|[[VU Title IX Office|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/title-ix/]]|\u000a|[[VU Project Safe|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/]] will research local resources when a student needs in-person advocacy or support, wherever they are--including abroad.|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Sexual Assault Support and Resources List|https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wp0/wp-content/uploads/sites/133/2013/11/11204527/Resource_List_2020_2021.pdf]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Grades and credits">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Immersing yourself">>\u000aYour study abroad experience can be even more exceptional if you really make the effort to immerse yourself in your new surroundings. Whether you capitalize on what your program offers or create your own opportunities, taking steps to make the most of your time overseas//will//pay off.\u000a\u000aThe study abroad alumni profiled below pursued research, internships, volunteering, and cultural experiences that have led to better career preparation, improved self-knowledge, and more advanced cross-cultural skills. How will //you// engage?\u000a\u000a!!!!I volunteered with Starfish, a service organization for trafficked women\u000aWhile studying in Beijing, I volunteered with the Starfish Project, a service organization that works with previously trafficked women. Starfish teaches vocational skills and provides continuing education and health care access. I taught English. Our English Corner, a regular group discussion in both Chinese and English on a variety of topics, gave me a fantastic opportunity to be involved in the exchange of cultures. Coming back to Vanderbilt, I decided to put more effort into immersing myself at home as well: I teach Spanish at the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, tutor in Chinese, and am looking forward to a future with strong connections to the global community.\u000a\u000aOmega Tennant\u000aCET Beijing, Spring 2013\u000aMajor: Human & Organizational Development\u000a\u000a!!!!I prepared for the experience I wanted to have--and interned at the Vienna State Opera\u000a\u000aI wanted to go to Vienna, but I knew I'd get much more out of it if I knew the language. So I went to summer language school beforehand, and with that grasp of German I was able to make local friends and attend Universitt Wien. When I somehow managed to become the (first-ever!) intern at the Vienna State Opera, it was a dream come true. In addition to learning the art and business of opera at one of the most important cultural institutions in the world, I got to see Austrian work and daily life from the inside. I fell in love with Vienna, and will be returning after graduation to make a life there.\u000a\u000aNora Pertz\u000aIES Vienna, Spring 2014\u000aMajors: Piano Performance, European Studies\u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Traveling with a musical instrument">>\u000aAir travel with a musical instrument can present special challenges. Many instruments are larger than the typical carry-on bag, and some are irregularly shaped. Certain instruments are fragile, exceptionally valuable, or contain protected materials. Here are some things to consider as you decide whether and how to bring your instrument.\u000a\u000aIf you have a large instrument, or a very valuable one, you may want to check into options for ''renting an instrument'' rather than dealing with transport. Contact your program provider or GEO to see whether renting is a viable option. \u000a\u000aThe airline you choose may greatly affect your transportation options. Check their ''guidelines for checked and carry-on baggage''. Some airlines allow 1-2 checked bags for no charge, while others charge even for a single checked bag. If your instrument is too large, you may be able to ''buy a seat next to you''. <<if $semester>>If you receive financial assistance, you may want to check with the Office of Financial Aid to see whether help might be available to cover the second seat.<</if>>\u000a\u000aOn full flights, airlines may require that carry-on items be checked. Arriving early to get through security and/or paying for advance boarding may help avoid this situation. But even if you plan to carry on your instrument, it is wise to ''pack it as though it will be checked''.\u000a\u000a''Pack your instrument'' in a hard-sided case with padding around it;  foam, bubble wrap, newspapers, and t-shirts work well as packing materials. Put a tag with your name, permanent address, and phone number both outside and inside your case. Include short instructions in case a security officer is handling and repacking your instrument.\u000a\u000aIt is also vitally important that you check to see if your instrument contains any [[protected materials|https://www.fws.gov/international/permits/by-activity/musical-instruments.html]] such as Brazilian rosewood, elephant ivory, tortoiseshell, or other rare plant or animal material. Some materials require [[special documentation or a permit|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips.html]], and if carrying them you must travel through [[specific ports|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips/designated-ports-of-entry-exit.html]].\u000a\u000aBefore you make final decisions about bringing a large instrument, you may want to check with your program provider to see what options you will have for ''instrument storage''. \u000a\u000a<<<\u000a''Predeparture checklist''\u000a\u000a<ul class="checklist">\u005c\u000a<li><<smartcheckbox "$todo.instrumentProtected">>Check whether your instrument contains [[protected materials|https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/factsheet-musical-instruments.pdf]] that require [[special documentation, a permit|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips.html]], or travel through [[specific ports|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips/designated-ports-of-entry-exit.html]].</li>\u000a<li><<smartcheckbox "$todo.instrumentStorage">>Inquire with your program provider about storing your instrument safely while abroad.

V<<sidebar "Transgender travelers">>\u000aTransgender students are valued members of the Vanderbilt community. Abroad, attitudes regarding transgender students may not be the same. Cultures may not support or value ''non-cisnormative genders or non-heteronormative sexualities'', and in some countries transgender people may face criminal sanctions simply because they are transgender. Before you travel abroad, ''learn more about the laws, customs, and attitudes'' of the country in which you will be studying. Some resources are provided at the end of this article as a starting point.\u000a\u000aWhen preparing to travel, be sure that your documents and IDs match your legal name and gender. We recognize this process can be anxiety-inducing and stressful for trans people; however, due to the legal system of the United States, ''the name, gender, and date of birth on your flight ticket must match the government-issued photo ID (i.e. passport) you provide when passing through security''. Perceived differences between documents and gender presentation may cause delays and/or additional screenings by travel agency staff. \u000a\u000aIf your US passport does not reflect your current gender, you can [[obtain a new ten-year passport with your updated gender|https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/passports]] but you must provide a ''letter from your physician'' documenting appropriate \u201cclinical treatment\u201d for gender transition. ''If you have decided to engage in the process of gender transition'', you can [[obtain a temporary two-year passport with your updated gender|https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/passports]]. If your passport does not match your gender/has not been updated to reflect your gender, you ''must apply in person'' at any passport acceptance facility. If you are applying for a change of name, you may be eligible to apply by mail. Consult [[details|https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/passports]] provided by the National Center for Transgender Equality. If you are not a US citizen, consult the embassy or consulate of your home country for requirements.\u000a\u000aWhen traveling, be aware that ''security screening'' may involve whole-body scanners (Advanced Imaging Technology) or a pat-down. If you opt out of the imaging scan, or if the machine detects something \u201cunusual\u201d (such as ''binding garments, prosthetics, or body parts the attendant did not assume you to have''), you will be required to go through a ''pat-down''. The officer working will assign an officer they assume matches your gender to perform the pat-down. Travelers may ''ask for a private screening'' at any time, and you may bring a travel companion in with you. You should never be required to lift or remove an article of clothing to reveal your body part(s) or a prosthetic item. If you use a prosthetic item, you are not required to remove it. \u000a\u000aIf you are carrying any ''medically prescribed items with you, bring documentation from your physician''. If you are on ''hormones'', talk with your physician about how to access medical treatment and prescriptions abroad. \u000a\u000aBe aware that traveling within your host country or crossing borders while abroad may also require documentation and security screenings.\u000a\u000aWhen planning for your trip, consider ''housing options'' that fit your comfort and safety levels. Single rooms might be best for personal freedom, but they may not be available or may cost more. It may be wise to talk to your program provider to seek trans-friendly roommates or host families. \u000a\u000aAfter considering potential safety issues, determine how you would like instructors and peers abroad to address you, for example with your ''preferred name and gender pronouns''. You may want to ask your program provider about the availability of ''gender inclusive restrooms''.\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions or concerns, feel free to [[contact GEO|https://vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising/]] and we will be happy to help you work through them.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association|https://davidson.studioabroad.com/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=05077A7671743F0777067173060A011C7C0D777C1A0C0307051C7174050501730706777D71707171020D]] (ILGA) provides a country-by-country analysis of attitudes and laws regarding LGBTQ people; not focused on transgender issues, but possibly broadly useful.|\u000a|More information on the new [[passport gender change policy|http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/kyr/passports_2014.pdf]] for US passport holders.|\u000a|How to [[apply for a limited 2-year US passport|https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/gender.html]] if you are in the process of gender transition.|\u000a|The National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) provides an [[ID Documents Center|http://www.transequality.org/documents]] to help you get a legal name change and update your name/gender on state and federal IDs and records.|\u000a|NCTE offers a [[\u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d report|http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/kyr/AirportSecurity_March2014.pdf]] on airport security and transgender people.|\u000a|If you do experience disrespectful treatment or other problems from airline staff, you may [[file a complaint|https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/file-consumer-complaint]] with the Aviation Consumer Protection Division.|\u000a|Check out a blog post on a [[Transgender Guide to Staying Safe While Traveling.|http://dopesontheroad.com/travel/transgender-guide-to-staying-safe-while-traveling/]]|\u000a|If you have a smart phone and are traveling within the U.S. or Europe, you can download the REFUGE Restroom app to help you locate gender inclusive restrooms.|\u000a|[[GEO's Global Safety and Security Manager|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/geo/advising#safetyadvising]], for personal guidance on safety and wellbeing for all travelers|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Career resources while abroad">>\u000aBefore you go abroad, consider [[connecting with a Career Coach|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/career/]] to discuss how studying abroad might benefit and intersect with your job or internship search.\u000a\u000aThe Career Center has many career resources available to you while you are abroad. Start with the [[Information for Students Studying Abroad|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/career/information-for/studyingabroad/]] page to become acquainted with resources and frequently asked questions from students. \u000a\u000aCareer Center resources are available to you while you are abroad. All of the ''Career Center\u2019s coaches are available'' by phone, Zoom, email, and Skype throughout the year to answer your questions and to help you explore and pursue jobs and internships. \u000a\u000aWhile you're abroad, you may want to ''make connections with Vanderbilt alumni'' who work in the countries you're visiting. These networking connections can often lead to opportunities. See the Career Center's [[Information for Students Studying Abroad|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/career/information-for/studyingabroad/]] page for notes on how to do this.\u000a\u000aIf you are ''invited to interview while you are abroad'', reach out and let the company know that you are abroad.

V!How to use international health insurance\u000a!!!!The basics of networks and claims\u000a\u000aMost international health insurers have their own network of partner clinics and hospitals around the world. When you use one of these <span title="A clinic is 'in-network' if the insurer has identified it as a preferred partner and has set up a direct billing relationship with the clinic.">in-network</span> clinics, billing should be straightforward: If the care you receive requires a <span title="A co-pay is the amount, usually expressed as a percentage, that the patient pays. The remainder is paid by the insurance company.">co-pay</span>, you will pay that to the clinic, usually on the day of your appointment. The clinic will then bill the balance to the insurer directly. You can find information on what percentage your insurer pays for different types of medical expenses in the insurer\u2019s guide to benefits.\u000a\u000a''What happens if it isn\u2019t convenient to visit an in-network clinic?''\u000aIf you can\u2019t visit an in-network clinic for any of your insurers, GEO recommends that you contact Vanderbilt\u2019s international health insurer (GeoBlue). You can call or email GeoBlue a few days in advance of an appointment and request that they set up a direct payment relationship with the provider.\u000a\u000aIf GeoBlue isn\u2019t able to set up direct payment, or you aren\u2019t able to call them ahead of time, don\u2019t worry. You can go to any medical establishment abroad, pay out of pocket, and then submit a claim to GeoBlue (remember to keep all your receipts!). If you need help with this process, please [[contact VIRT|mailto:virt@vanderbilt.edu]].\u000a\u000a''How do you decide which plan to use?''\u000aYou might have multiple insurance policies available while you\u2019re abroad. All students on GEO programs will have Vanderbilt\u2019s international insurance. Your study abroad program may have its own insurance that will also cover you, and students who are on exchange programs may also be required to purchase specific national health insurance. Here's how you can approach this:\u000a\u000a# Compare your coverage across the different policies: If one policy covers you for a specific condition and another does not, that is important information. It\u2019s also important to know whether the co-pays differ between insurance policies. If one covers you at 100%, but the other has a 20% co-pay, you will probably want to submit for reimbursement under the policy that grants full coverage.\u000a# If your program purchases specific health insurance on your behalf, your program staff probably has a good working knowledge of that insurer and its network of providers. Consult with them to get a good sense of where to go for treatment.\u000a# You can always use the coverage from Vanderbilt\u2019s international insurer (GeoBlue). If you do, VIRT is available to help you come to terms with the process.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|Before you leave: [[Vanderbilt's Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]], for personal guidance on internation insurance, health and wellness, and safety for all travelers|\u000a|While you're abroad: [[Contact VIRT|mailto:virt@vanderbilt.edu]] to inquire about using Vanderbilt\u2019s international health insurance to access medical services|\u000a|[[Brief coverage and services description|https://geo.vanderbilt.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=2361]] for Vanderbilt\u2019s international health insurer|\u000a|[[Detailed description of coverage|https://geo.vanderbilt.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=15554]] for Vanderbilt\u2019s international health insurer|\u000a|[[General guide to medical care and insurance|http://www.studentsabroad.com/handbook/medical-care-and-insurance.php?country=General]] from StudentsAbroad.com|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Culture shock">>\u005c\u000a\u000a

V!Getting there (and back again)\u000a!!!!Considerations around planning your trip\u000aWith the coronavirus epidemic still impacting travel worldwide, there are a number of realities and possibilities to keep in mind.\u000a\u000aGEO recommends you purchase a ''flexible class of airline ticket'' that allows for itinerary changes at minimal cost. Given ever-shifting coronavirus precautions and entry/exit requirements, ''simpler itineraries are preferred''.\u000a\u000aRequirements are changing rapidly, but when you arrive in your host country, you ''//may// be required to quarantine''. If so, this quarantine is likely to be stricter than the self-isolation requirements you may have encountered in the US in the early days of the pandemic. For example, you likely would not be able to receive guests or go outside. If a quarantine looks likely when you travel, we strongly encourage you to think about what you can do to avoid boredom and support your mental health. Here is a [[helpful list of guidelines|https://iocdf.org/covid19/self-care-during-covid-19/]] to get you started.\u000a\u000aRequirements and restrictions imposed by the US government, foreign governments, regional governments, airlines, or other entities may change at any time. ''You are ultimately responsible'' for being aware of and taking action to ensure that you meet all these requirements.\u000a\u000aCurrently, all travelers\u2014regardless of vaccination status\u2014will need to show a negative COVID-19 test result (or proof of recovery from COVID) to [[return to the United States|https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/covid-19_testing_required_US_Entry.html]]. Your program will likely help you arrange for this testing. However, if you plan to travel independently after your program, be sure that you will be in a location where you can take a test of the correct type in the days prior to departure, verify that it can be completed as quickly as you need it to be, make an appointment for that test as needed, and ensure you have funds available to pay for the test. To review the type of test and documentation you\u2019ll need, see the [[CDC\u2019s guidelines|https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/pdf/Airline_Testing_Order_Checklist-p.pdf]]. Be aware that ''airlines interpret CDC rules and that you should check with your airline as to what constitutes sufficient proof''\u2014including the language(s) that documentation may be submitted in. See the [[CDC\u2019s website|https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html]] for more information.\u000a\u000aIf you need to ''travel on an emergency basis'' while you are abroad, that is unlikely to happen immediately. Due to the (current) need to show a negative test result before traveling to the US, as well as other regulations and requirements, you should not plan on being able to leave within a window of less than 48 hours. For example, if there is a family emergency and you need to return home to the US, you will not be able to do so immediately. If your family lives outside the US, you might want to research and keep up with the requirements you need to fulfill to return to your home country.\u000a\u000aGEO generally recommends that you consider supplemental insurance to cover your entire time abroad. ''Trip cancellation/trip interruption'' and ''theft insurance'' are particularly worthwhile options. GEO cannot recommend specific  plans or providers, but you can check with your travel agent, home/auto  insurance agent, or online. During COVID-19, decisions about trip interruption insurance may be more complicated; if you are considering this option, the [[Office of Global Safety|https://www.vanderbilt.edu/global/global-safety/]] would be happy to consult with you.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[How do I go about getting a travel visa?|How to get a travel visa]]\u000a   [[Can I arrive early or leave late from my study abroad site?|Early arrivals]]\u000a   [[What about traveling with a musical instrument?|Traveling with a musical instrument]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Passport Check">>\u005c
