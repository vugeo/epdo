V!Vanderbilt policy on alcohol abroad\u000a!!!!Be aware of legal rules and cultural norms\u000aVanderbilt does not really treat alcohol use abroad any differently than it does on campus--you still need to abide by the ''legal drinking age'' of the country you're in. In all of the countries where Vanderbilt has approved study abroad programs, the drinking age is lower than it is here in Nashville, so you may find that your legal status is different. Just remember that violations of law or of institutional policy overseas may also become grounds for disciplinary action both at Vanderbilt and under the rules of your abroad program.\u000a\u000aAt the same time that you are considering the legal implications of drinking, be mindful of ''cultural norms'' surrounding alcohol use in your host country. In many countries, for example, American-style "binge drinking" may appear pathological or merely pathetic. Take the opportunity to see cultural practices in a new light. \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!The Student Handbook says:|\u000a|Students are required to abide by the laws of the respective countries in which they reside, study, or travel, with respect to the age at which alcoholic beverages may be consumed. Otherwise, the policies with respect to [[alcoholic beverages and controlled substances|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcoholic-beverage-and-controlled-substances-policies/ ]] included in the Vanderbilt //Student Handbook// apply. Students are subject to student-accountability sanctions, including expulsion, and referral for prosecution for violation of these policies.|\u000a|<hr>//From// [[VU Student Handbook, Study Abroad|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/university-policies-and-regulations/#study-abroad]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Sexual misconduct abroad">>\u005c

You are part of a worldwide web of interactions, and the impression you make on the people of your <span title="The country you are studying abroad in, i.e. the country that is 'hosting' you.">host country</span> definitely reflects on where you come from.\u000a\u000aTake some time to learn about norms in the country you're visiting so that you can attempt to blend in socially. Beyond that, treat those you meet courteously and with sensitivity toward cultural differences. Remember, you are in their world!\u000a\u000aYou are ''subject to local laws'' while you are abroad. Foreign laws and legal systems may be quite different from those in your home country, and you should get to know the key differences.

V!Tips for packing\u000a!!!!Pack light and pack smart\u000aIn GEO's experience, students experience two primary difficulties with packing: They bring too much stuff, and they often don't plan well enough for their specific destination. Here are some tips to help out.\u000a\u000a''Research your location's climate'' and the prevailing weather patterns for the time you will be there, and pack accordingly. Wikipedia is a good source for basic climate data on nearly every city in the world (just search for your city), but commercial guidebooks are probably the single best source of information. \u000a\u000a''Bring only //one// suitcase,'' one you can lift and maneuver without help. If you bring a backpack as your carry-on, it can double as a weekend travel bag.\u000a\u000a''Consider bringing a light duffel bag'' that you can fold up and put in your large suitcase. You may need it to bring the things you buy abroad back home.\u000a\u000aOnly ''pack wardrobe pieces that are interchangeable'' and are good for layering. If it can\u2019t be used to make multiple outfits, it doesn\u2019t belong in your suitcase! Items that can be dressed up or dressed down are ideal.\u000a\u000aFor more tips and a detailed list of suggestions, download GEO's [[packing checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=14068]].\u000a\u000a<<segue "Identity and diversity">>\u005c

V!Passport and Document Security\u000a!!!!Keep your passport and other key documents safe\u000aWhen you are abroad, no single document is more important than your passport. Without it, ''you will not be able to cross international borders'', and other tasks--such as transferring funds--may also become difficult or impossible. Losing your passport can be a major headache, and might even cost you thousands of dollars in airfare for missed flights. Do everything you can to keep it safe.\u000a<img src="images/passport wallet.jpg" class="right" style="height: 250px;" />\u005c\u000a\u000aIn general, you should keep your passport on your person only when you are traveling across borders. Otherwise, ''find a safe place for it and leave it there.'' Make a photocopy and carry that on you when you are out and about.\u000a\u000aIf you must carry your passport with you, keep it in a special ''passport wallet'' under your clothes.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!(Potentially) Good Places to Keep Your Passport|\u000a|Hidden in the room of your homestay or residence hall|\u000a|In your hotel's safe (//not// the room safe)|\u000a|With your study abroad provider, if they offer such a service|\u000a|<hr>//In some situations, even these options may not be secure.

V<<sidebar "How to get a travel visa">>\u000aA ''travel visa'' is not a credit card! It's a stamp or sticker placed in your passport that allows you to enter a foreign country. Depending on your own nationality and your reasons for traveling, ''you may or may not need a visa'' to visit a given country.\u000a\u000a<<if $facultyled>>Faculty-led courses abroad will generally require only a tourist visa, or for US passport holders many will require no visa at all. However, if<<else>>If<</if>> you will be taking classes from an institution based in your host country, you will usually need a student-class visa to enter. Entry requirements are often lower when you are simply visiting as a tourist.<<if $facultyled>> If you aren't sure whether you need a student-class visa, talk with your faculty leader.\u000a\u000a''If you will not be traveling on a US passport'', you may have different entry requirements from others traveling on your program. It is your responsibility to be aware of these requirements and obtain required visa(s). GEO can help get your oriented to the process. \u000a\u000a<</if>> Requirements to get a visa may include photographs, financial information, a letter from your host university, a criminal background check, an HIV test, or even a personal appearance at the foreign consulate.

V!Traveling while abroad\u000a!!!!Important things to keep in mind when planning travel\u000aGEO recommends that you consider supplemental insurance to cover your entire time abroad. ''Trip cancellation/trip interruption and theft insurance'' are particularly worthwhile options. GEO cannot recommend specific plans or providers, but you can check with your travel agent, home/auto insurance agent, or online.\u000a\u000aSome programs may provide opportunities for independent travel. First, always ''keep your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director or program staff<</if>> informed'' of your travel. Also keep your family in the loop; if there is an emergency back home, they will want to know how get in touch with you.\u000a\u000aSome countries that you plan to visit may have different entry requirements than your primary host country. ''Investigate all the countries you're interested in'' before you leave the US. If any require a <span title="A stamp or sticker placed in your passport that allows you to enter a foreign country.">travel visa</span>, it will probably be easier to get the visa while you're in the US--this applies to both international students and US citizens!\u000a\u000aIn every country you visit, make a point of knowing where your ''home country's nearest embassy or consulate'' is. You want to know where you can find support if you get into real trouble. (If you're a US citizen, you should bookmark the [[list of US embassies around the world|http://www.usembassy.gov/]].)\u000a\u000aFinally, independent travel is one of the ''most expensive activities'' you can undertake abroad. Be sure to budget appropriately, and remember to consider safety while you're on the lookout for ways to travel on the cheap.\u000a<<if not $facultyled>><div class="talkbox">\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Wisdom from alums|\u000a|Every year, students tell us that while they loved the traveling they did abroad, they also regretted not getting to know their host city better.

V!Traveling with medications\u000a!!!!Ensure continuity in your medical care\u000aDrugs that are regularly prescribed in the US can sometimes be restricted abroad. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be interdicted overseas. Take precautions when traveling to ensure that your medications don't get you in trouble.\u000a\u000a''Keep all of your medications in their original packaging'' when traveling. This will trigger less suspicion from customs agents and law enforcement.\u000a\u000aTo find out if any of your medications are restricted or banned in your host country, you can work with healthcare providers at Vanderbilt Student Health or the Psychological and Counseling Center. You can also [[contact the country's embassy|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]]. Ask about over-the-counter drugs too if they are a part of your regular care regime.\u000a\u000aWhatever the legal status of your medications, ''request a letter from your physician'' explaining why the drugs you are transporting have been prescribed to you. Also include over-the-counter drugs if needed. You will want to take this letter with you //whenever you travel!// Request that your doctor use the local brand names or generic/chemical names for your drugs (see resources below).\u000a\u000aWhen possible, ''take enough medicine with you to cover your entire stay abroad''. If your medicine is only available in limited supply, or your doctor prefers that you have a clinician onsite to refill your prescription, please discuss with your physician and program staff how you will obtain enough for your stay. \u000a\u000aBe aware that medications ''cannot be sent through the mail!''\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[MedlinePlus|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]], information on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including generic/chemical names|\u000a|[[HTH Drug Translation Guide|https://www.hthstudents.com/drug/index1.cfm]], offers equivalent brand names and availability for frequently visited countries/destinations|\u000a|[[Directory of Foreign Embassies|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]], US Department of State|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Tips for packing">>\u005c

V!Money\u000a!!!!Use debit and credit cards wisely to save money\u000aThe amount of money you spend while studying abroad will vary depending on the local cost of living, your personal spending habits, independent travel, and so on. //How you access your money// can also play a role in maintaining your budget.\u000a\u000aMany businesses will not accept plastic, especially for smaller purchases, so it's a good idea to have ''cash'' on hand throughout your time abroad. The most cost-effective way to get cash abroad is to use your ''debit card'' (not a credit card!) in an ATM. You can usually find out where the ATMs you might need are before you leave the US--ask your bank how.\u000a\u000aGEO also recommends that you bring a ''credit card''. Be aware that every credit card purchase or debit card withdrawal will likely carry transaction fees. Shop around a bit for the best rates before you leave the US, but also minimize the number of times you use your cards. Take out as much cash as you feel comfortable with each time you use the ATM, and use your credit card only when necessary or when you have an especially large purchase.\u000a\u000aBefore you depart the US, and every time you enter a new country, you should inform your bank(s) of your location. If you don't, you may find your cards canceled as an anti-fraud measure! \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Summary|\u000a|Before you leave, consider seeking out the US banks with the best currency conversion and transaction fees for your host country.|\u000a|Call your bank(s) to let them know you'll be abroad.

V<<sidebar "Basics of budgeting">>\u000aBudgeting can be crucial to ensure you have enough money to fund your study abroad experience. There are really two levels of budgeting that you need to keep in mind.\u000a\u000aFirst is the ''overall budget for your study abroad experience''. Getting a ballpark figure for this will help you and your family determine an appropriate weekly budget for you while you are abroad. Be sure to include not only the costs that are billed through Vanderbilt, but also the clear, fixed costs that you will pay out of pocket. Examples include: passport fees, visa fees, airfare, luggage fees, and purchase of clothing or other travel needs.\u000a\u000aTo this, you need to add an estimate of what you will spend on living expenses and entertainment and enrichment activities. These can be tricky to estimate, especially because a sudden change in currency exchange rates can alter the calculation substantially. <<if $facultyled>>Your faculty leader should be able to give you a better idea of costs on the ground.<<else>>GEO offers rough estimates in our cost calculator, but your program provider can give you a better idea of your costs on the ground. You can also use online cost-of-living calculators (see the Resources section below).<</if>>\u000a\u000aNow that you have a blanket estimate of costs, you and your family can determine how much you should aim to spend per week. Here is where you will need to figure out how to maintain your week-to-week budget while you are abroad. \u000a\u000aA ''week-to-week budget'' is a detailed plan of the money you plan to spend, divided into categories: so much for food, so much for travel, and so on. You may need to revise it as you go. For example, you may overspend one week and need to cut back in future weeks.<<if not $shortterm>> Keep in mind that students often spend more money the first few weeks while becoming acquainted with their new surroundings.<</if>> [[More tips on budgeting from GEO|http://prezi.com/hkf9icfmogbd/budgeting-while-abroad/]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Numbeo|http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/]], international cost of living database and calculator|\u000a|[[Expatistan|http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living]], international cost of living database and calculator|\u000a|[[OANDA|http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/]] currency exchange converter, including historical trends|\u000a|[[Maintain a Personal Budget|http://www.wikihow.com/Maintain-a-Budget-for-Personal-Use]], a general budgeting guide|\u000a|[[Budgeting While Abroad|http://prezi.com/hkf9icfmogbd/budgeting-while-abroad/]], GEO's tips for maintaining a budget while abroad|\u000a|[[Budget tracking sheet|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Alj5J4V4xlpIdEx2Q0ZWME9ISnlEQms1ZzRLenkyNlE#gid=0]], a Google spreadsheet that helps automate budget tracking|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Where will you live?">>\u005c

V!Phones and internet abroad\u000a!!!!Basic advice and information\u000a\u000a<<$- "Cell phones">> GEO doesn't recommend one cell phone provider over another, but here are some resources to help you figure out what is best for you.\u000a\u000aIf you plan to take your own phone abroad, be sure to check with your phone company for their international plans and rates. Also check their data-roaming fees, since those can rack up fast!\u000a\u000aHowever, you should ''consider leaving your cell phone at home'' and purchasing a cheap phone when you arrive. In fact, that is what we at GEO recommend you do. Or you could buy a cheap unlocked phone before you leave and get the appropriate SIM card when you arrive in your host country. (Some airports sell SIMs in the international arrivals section, so they can be quite easy to come by.)\u000a\u000aYou may want to talk to your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>study abroad provider (or look at their predeparture materials)<</if>> to see if they have specific recommendations on how to handle phones in your host country. You can also visit this [[international cell phone guide|http://www.independenttraveler.com/travel-tips/stay-connected/international-cell-phone-guide]] to get a good overview of the options.\u000a\u000a<<$- "Dialing Telephones">> The details of dialing internationally vary depending on which countries you're trying to connect. Check out [[How To Call Abroad|http://www.howtocallabroad.com/]] and share it with family and friends.\u000a\u000a<<$- "Internet">> Internet access abroad is typically not the same as in the US. While you will have access, prepare yourself for slower connections. Depending on your host location, you might have a weekly usage limit in your room or at your college, or you may need to pay for internet access at a cafe. Talk with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program provider or host university<</if>> to find out what to expect.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Communicating with home|Communicating with home]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Disabilities and accommodations">>\u005c

V!Contacts and communications\u000a!!!!Who should I contact for help abroad?\u000aCommunications abroad can seem difficult at first.

You will find out more about who your contact(s) should be in your program-specific predeparture orientation.\u000a\u000a''Remember this:'' Problems will be resolved faster if you work with someone who is on the ground with you rather than contacting someone back home who is a few time zones and thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Hm...">>\u000a   [[When should I contact Vanderbilt or the Global Education Office?|When to contact Vanderbilt]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Phones and internet abroad">>

In addition to providing you with a letter, they can help you think through what you might need to ask of your program staff abroad.\u000a\u000aDo understand that while most requests will be honored, laws in other countries regarding required or reasonable accommodations often differ from what is mandated by law in the United States.

(If you're not sure what your housing options are, talk to the GEO advisor for your program.)\u000a\u000aBut since you may be facing a choice soon, we want to share with you what alumni of Vanderbilt study abroad tell us in their program evaluations: Students who live with natives of their host country typically report greater satisfaction with their housing and integration into the local culture than students who live with Americans. This is true whether students lived with a homestay family or with native roommates of their own age.\u000a<<display "Housing chart">>\u005c\u000a<<else>>Students on most faculty-led summer courses will live in hotels, hostels, or in the residence halls of partner universities.

Vanderbilt's [[Office of Housing and Residential Education|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ResEd/main/]] does make housing available to students whose programs are partially taught abroad, but an advance application is required.\u000a\u000aApplications for Maymester/Summer housing are generally made available in mid-April, and move-in is usually on or around the day that residence halls close to non-graduating students.

The US Department of State provides a [[directory of foreign embassies|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]]. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be more restricted abroad, so ask if you have doubts.\u000a\u000aTo ''find the generic or chemical name'' of a drug, you can check the National Institutes of Health's [[MedlinePlus website|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]].

V!Before you leave\u000a!!!!Know where you are medically before you depart\u000aRegardless of whether you have an existing medical condition, there are a few things you should do before you go abroad.\u000a\u000aFirst, consult with a travel medicine clinic (such as the one at the [[VU Student Health Center|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/student-health/travel-medicine]]) about any ''vaccinations'' that might be necessary or advisable. You should do this as soon as possible!\u000a\u000aMeet with your medical, dental, and other care providers for a ''full checkup''. You don't want to be blindsided by an unnoticed condition when you arrive in your new location.\u000a\u000aIf you have an existing medical or mental health condition, have an honest discussion with your care providers about your current history and ''how study abroad will fit into your care plan''.\u000a\u000aWhile you know your history, your program staff does not. In an emergency, you may not be able to relay information that is critical to your care. //Please// ''disclose any physical or mental health conditions'' to your program staff prior to arrival.

Request a letter from your physician explaining your use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs to ensure that you will be allowed entry into your host country.\u000a\u000aWork with the travel clinic mental health team to ''identify resources for obtaining your prescriptions'' in your host country.

V!Culture shock\u000a!!!!The process of adjusting to a new culture\u000aStudy abroad is an amazing time in the lives of students. Yet it is natural to have difficulty adjusting to a new culture. We call the feelings associated with this adaptation process "culture shock," and they take a variety of forms. These may include homesickness, sadness, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and more.\u000a\u000aCulture shock is usually not sudden or "shocking." Instead, it describes a continuum of feelings. Usually, there is a period of excitement when you first arrive--there is so much to see and do! The more negative feelings associated with culture shock typically come soon after. The good news is that culture shock is temporary<<if $shortterm>>, and when you are on a short-term program you may not experience it at all.<<else>>. Nearly all students will, after a few weeks, adjust to and thrive in their new surroundings.<</if>>\u000a\u000aHow long culture shock lasts and how difficult it is, of course, differs depending on the person. If you are having a hard time adjusting--especially if others on your program seem to be doing fine--reach out to your resident staff or <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>director<</if>> to explain what you are feeling.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that you will likely experience a similar adjustment period when you return home and back to Vanderbilt. Students often tell us that this "shock" is harder than going abroad. \u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[How can I cope with culture shock or other stress abroad?|Coping with stress and culture shock]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Illness abroad">>\u005c

Also ''know what your insurance covers'' and how to file and pay claims.\u000a\u000a''This insurance only covers you outside the United States.'' GEO strongly encourages all students to maintain health insurance in their home country. If unforeseen circumstances force you to return home, you want subsidized care to be available.\u000a\u000aInternational health insurance usually ''only covers you for the official dates of your program.'' If you are planning to travel before or after your program begins, GEO recommends that you purchase additional short-term coverage.

It will usually be someone on site, with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program's resident director or staff<</if>> at the top of the list. Don't contact home for help unless you've exhausted all your local contacts.\u000a\u000aWhen you arrive at your program site, you should receive a list of all appropriate emergency contacts for your program<<if not $facultyled>> or host university<</if>>, as well as for emergency services (police, ambulance, etc.). If you don't receive this information, ask for it! Also consider recording it on GEO's [[handy wallet-sized card|$emergencyCardURL]].\u000a\u000aRemember that phone numbers for emergency services will be different in each country you might visit. Get that information before you take a side trip.\u000a\u000aBe aware of <<if $facultyled>>your instructor's absence and illness policies.<<else>>the absence and illness policies for your program or host university. They may differ drastically from Vanderbilt policies.<</if>> Always keep your program staff in the loop while ill (via email or phone). \u000a\u000aBe sure to keep any doctor's notes for your files.

V<<sidebar "Going abroad ... again!">>\u000aStudents who return from abroad often feel the need to go abroad again.\u000a\u000aIf you are not graduating and you have room in your academic schedule, you are welcome to ''apply for another GEO study abroad program''--there is no rule that says you can only go once! Or, if you are more strapped for time, consider ''volunteering abroad''. You can go over break either with the [[Office of Active Citizenship and Service|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/oacs/]] (OACS) or on your own. You may even be able to find funding (ask OACS about the [[Nichols Humanitarian Fund|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/nicholsfund/]]).\u000a\u000aOr consider ''graduate studies abroad''. Several universities around the world welcome international students for graduate degrees. Many have more reasonable tuition fees than you will find in the US, yet with comparable educational quality and prestige. It is often possible to apply US federal financial aid toward studies at recognized institutions. Some countries, like the United Kingdom, will even give you a 1- or 2-year work visa upon completion of an advanced degree in their country.\u000a\u000aAnother option might be ''working or interning abroad'', including teaching English abroad. Visit GEO's [[Career page|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2A18AE-0A6B-2220-EA57131A558B072C&Link_ID=1B3AFB7F-CCFB-5B8C-F4E22E5CBC34F1E5&pID=2&lID=21]] for resources and tips for finding an international job, or consult with our sister office the [[English Language Center|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/elc/]] if you are interested in teaching English overseas.\u000a\u000a<<segue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

V!Opportunities for returned students\u000a!!!!There's sooooo much you can do when you get home!\u000aYour study abroad experience doesn't have to end when you return to the US! In fact, our goal is to ensure that you can extend and process your experience when you return home.\u000a\u000aGEO offers programming specifically for returning students. We sponsor a ''student organization,'' [[GEO Study Abroad Alumni (GEOSAA)|https://anchorlink.vanderbilt.edu/organization/geosaa]], which hosts social dinners and workshops. Our [[annual conference|http://vanderbi.lt/icgrsa]] helps you unpack your experience and/or share your newfound insights about the world with fellow students.\u000a\u000aWhen you return, you can also ''volunteer with'' or ''work for GEO''; it's a great way to share your experience with other students. You can also get involved in our own local community: you may be surprised how international Nashville really is!\u000a\u000aStudying abroad can make you a great candidate for ''prestigious honors scholarships'' when you return home. Some of these, such as the Fulbright Fellowship or Critical Language Summer Institutes, may even send you abroad again. These opportunities may require advance planning, though, so we encourage you to study the offerings and discuss your interests with the [[Office of Honor Scholarships|http://ohs.vanderbilt.edu]] //before you leave//.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[More ideas and resources for getting involved after you return|More ideas and resources for getting involved]]\u000a   [[What possibilities exist for me to go abroad again after I return?|Going abroad again]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "GEO\u2019s annual Photo Contest">>\u005c

V!Reverse culture shock\u000a!!!!Be prepared for coming home to be a bumpy ride\u000aIt may seem like a distant reality now, but part of the study abroad experience is returning home. Many students tell GEO that this is harder than expected, and often harder than going abroad to begin with!\u000a\u000aLook, reverse culture shock is a fact. Returning home after a significant period of time abroad is in some ways just like going abroad. You have changed, your perceptions have changed, and you are now used to living in and interacting with a different culture. You may even find that readjusting to life in the US is more difficult than the initial adaption to your host country. Instead of ignoring this reverse culture shock, learn about effective ways to combat it. Rest assured, there are many resources that may be helpful as you make the adjustment to being back at home. You can find some resources on GEO's website (under [[Reverse Culture Shock|http://vanderbi.lt/reversecultureshock]]); you might want to bookmark that page for when you come back. Some useful resources are also listed below.\u000a\u000aSome students benefit from supportive counseling when struggling with reverse culture shock.

V!GEO's annual Photo Contest\u000a!!!!Keep the contest in mind as you decide what to photograph!\u000aEvery year, GEO conducts a photo contest. We solicit photos from students who went abroad in the 12 months previous and choose the best images to feature.\u000a\u000aWe will contact you via email, usually in the summer, to request your entries in the contest. \u000aThere are prizes, and we invite the entire Vanderbilt campus and alumni community to take part in the judging process. If you're a winner, your photo will be seen by thousands or tens of thousands of people! We put the winning photos on live exhibit on campus, and they tend to show up in campus publications as well, including //Vanderbilt Magazine.//\u000a\u000aPhotos can be of any subject (scenery, activities, cultures, etc.) but please be tasteful and respectful as you snap your pics.\u000a\u000aIf you just want to share photos of your experiences without entering the contest, [[we have an outlet for that too|http://www.jotformpro.com/form/21576745147965]].\u000a\u000aGEO is particularly keen on photos that show Vanderbilt students participating in academic and cultural endeavors.

V!Preparation and responsibilities\u000a!!!!Getting ready and seizing opportunities\u000aThere are many things that you need to do to prepare to go abroad. <<if not ($summer or $maymester)>>What should you do about your on-campus housing? Your meal plan? Your Commodore Card? What if you would like to pursue additional funding?\u000a\u000a<</if>>GEO can't help you manage everything, of course, but we have put together a checklist of things to do not only before you leave, but also while you're abroad and after you return to the US. (Later in this presentation, we'll also discuss tips for packing, getting a passport/visa, traveling with prescription drugs, and other topics.)\u000a\u000aIn addition to responsibilities, the checklist also highlights opportunities you can prepare for or take advantage of while you are abroad.

V!Making friends\u000a!!!!Consider your goals as well as your opportunities\u000aStarting off in a foreign country is in some ways like being a first-year student again. //Everything// is new, including all or most of the other students. Most study abroad programs offer orientation activities at the beginning of the term. Take advantage of social opportunities during this orientation. It's your best chance to get to know the other participants, and it's not hard--luckily, they happen to be in the market for new friends too!\u000a\u000aWhile it will be great to have friends in your program, you should be aware of the disadvantages of spending too much time with other Americans. If your goals include meeting local people, learning the language, or becoming something more than a long-stay tourist, you will need to look beyond the American crowd.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Meeting local people">>\u005c

V!Meeting local people\u000a!!!!Get involved--outside your comfort zone\u000aGEO strongly encourages our students to get to know local people and students in more than superficial ways. Not only does this provide the greatest opportunities for building cross-cultural and language skills, it will also give you a more meaningful experience. <<if $facultyled or $shortterm>>\u000a\u000aWhile your opportunities may be limited by the short duration and intense schedule of your program, you can still enrich your experience by making some efforts.<<else>>Still, getting to know locals can seem daunting.<</if>> Here are some tips.\u000a\u000a<<if $facultyled>>Start by chatting with your ''faculty leader''. Let him or her know of your interest in the local culture, and you will probably get some tips that are well-tailored to the particular opportunities available on your program.\u000a\u000a<</if>><<if not $facultyled and not $shortterm>><<if $summer>>Your program may <<else>>In most countries, your visa or residence permit will <</if>>allow you to ''volunteer'' in the community or even do an ''internship'': fantastic ways to immerse yourself in the local culture while also beefing up your resume. If you have questions about whether you can volunteer<<if not $summer>> in your country<</if>>, [[contact GEO|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2936BD-9D45-883A-02A56AC77951A353&Link_ID=1B34B64E-9B4D-6FCE-D278333739D84B5D&pID=1&lID=5]] or your program provider.\u000a\u000a<</if>>If you will be living with a ''host family'', explore the opportunities provided by their wider social network. They likely know people that you might like to get to know!\u000a\u000a<<if not $shortterm>>If you are enrolled in or taking classes at a university, join ''student organizations'' on campus. Your campus probably has many clubs and intramural sports, and joining up is a great way to find locals who share your interests.\u000a\u000a<</if>><<if not $facultyled>>Visit your university's ''office of international student services''. In addition to local knowledge about bus routes and student discounts, they may offer inexpensive excursions and other social opportunities.\u000a\u000a<</if>>Most important, ''put yourself out there!'' It may be uncomfortable at first, but it will pay off in the long run.

V<<sidebar "Gifts and relationships">>\u000aPresenting a gift shows that you value a relationship--even a new one. Consider a gift to start off your more important relationships abroad, such as with your homestay family or a host-country roommate.\u000a\u000aIn a cross-cultural setting, the best gifts can be those that let you bring a little of where you're from to the relationship. Examples might include a Vanderbilt mug or pendant, a photo book about Nashville or your hometown, maple syrup if you're from Vermont, or maybe biscuit or grits mix if you're from the South. Not only are gifts like these polite, positive, well-meaning gestures, they can also spur conversations ("Is an American biscuit the same thing as a scone?").\u000a\u000aPhotos of home are another great conversation starter. Make sure you bring along some photos of your family, your house, your campus, your hobbies, and so on. It's a great way for people to feel like they are getting to know you and where you come from. \u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Academic systems abroad">>\u000a<<if $facultyled>>Thinking about spending a semester overseas? Read below to learn more about academic systems abroad, and how they might differ from what you're used to in the US.<<else>>Higher education and academic systems abroad can vary greatly from what you are used to in the United States. Here are some things that might be different depending on the country. Talk to your GEO advisor to find out more about what you might encounter on your program.<</if>>\u000a\u000a!!!!!!Potential differences in academic systems abroad\u000a*There may be fewer hours spent in the classroom, and students are expected to spend more time studying on their own. This doesn't mean that there will be assigned homework! A lot of responsibility for deciding how best to spend your homework hours may be left up to you.\u000a*Depending on the course and level you are taking, and whether you are taking it in a foreign language, you may need to spend extra time learning and mastering the material.\u000a*There may be fewer tests and quizzes, and students may earn a grade based on just one final exam, or a mid-term and a final. You may have little opportunity to gauge how a professor grades in the weeks or months before an exam.\u000a*Professors may be less accessible for office hours and by email.\u000a*Classes may be more lecture-style than discussion-based. This may leave fewer opportunities to ask questions or express your opinions.\u000a*There may not be much sense of privacy attached to grades. For example, the instructor might post all exam grades publicly. In some places, individual grades may be discussed openly in class.\u000a*The prevailing academic culture may be very different. For example, students may not be as concerned--or concerned at all--about getting high grade point averages.\u000a*In some places, such as Latin America, students pursue something like a strict professional degree, without a liberal arts component. They will have had a much more focused academic experience than you and your US-educated peers.\u000a*Students likely do not live on campus, which may mean that you need to meet people through academics at first, or by joining a club or other activity.<<if not $facultyled>>\u000a<hr>//Every country is different!

V!Identity and diversity\u000a!!!!Research beliefs, attitudes, and experiences\u000aOur surroundings shape us and help to define who we are. <<if $shortterm>>Experiencing<<else>>Living<</if>> in another cultural context will give you the chance to explore many facets of your identity, and to do so in light of new surroundings. Students overwhelmingly tell us that this process leads to increased personal growth and insight. However, it often carries difficulties too.\u000a\u000aAs you gear up for your time abroad, prepare yourself for how people in your new culture will perceive you. Just as in the US, people abroad will have beliefs, myths, stereotypes, and prejudices about aspects of personal identity. You may also find that the way(s) in which you identify yourself in the US differ from how others will identify you abroad.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!You might be surprised to learn...|\u000a|No matter what their background, the components of identity that most impact the experience of students abroad are ''nationality'' and ''gender''.|\u000a\u000aResearch the viewpoints held by people of your host country, including beliefs, laws, and customs that revolve around nationality, race and ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, mobility, and more. You may be able to prevent or at least alleviate cultural misunderstandings by learning as much as you can about your host culture before leaving.

V<<sidebar "Race and ethnicity abroad">>\u000aDepending on who you are and where you are going, you may feel a part of a racial or ethnic majority for the first time in your life. Or you may have the opposite experience, becoming a racial minority in one fell swoop. Either way, you will likely find that your ethnic or racial identity has different implications in your new host country than it has at home. \u000a\u000aThese new vantage points on self and identity can be exciting, but they can also be difficult. People may consistently misidentify you based on physical appearance, for example. Or you may be surprised at how freely people comment on appearance. If your appearance is very exotic for your host culture, you may find that you are stared at, or that people want to touch your hair or skin.\u000a\u000aOr, it's possible that your physical appearance and racial or ethnic identity is almost totally ignored, and all that really seems to matter is your nationality or gender.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling to a location that is part of your own heritage, be aware that people there may not see your heritage as the most important thing about you. If you are from the US, you may find that people there identify you as an American first. You should be prepared to be considered an outsider.   \u000a\u000aFor all of these reasons, it will be wise to prepare yourself in advance for the attitudes on race and ethnicity held by people of your host country.

V<<sidebar "Sexual and gender identity abroad">>\u000aIf you identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, or intersex, you will want to take time to consider whether and how you plan to be out abroad. Depending on where you are traveling, your destination may provide you with either a more open environment than the US, or a much less welcoming one. Either way, be prepared: make yourself aware in advance of local attitudes, beliefs, and understandings. Ask yourself questions like the following:\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions for LGBTQI Students to Consider:|\u000a|What behaviors are legal in my host country? If I am interested in activism, are there ways to practice it both safely and legally?|\u000a|<hr>Is it safe for me to be out in my host country and city?|\u000a|<hr>How open do I want or need to be about my gender or sexual identity while abroad? Do I plan to be out? How specifically will I reconcile my human rights with the cultural values of my host country?|\u000a|<hr>If my destination is one where I need to conceal my identity, how will this impact my experience?|\u000a|<hr>What are the cultural norms surrounding friendship and dating in my host culture?|\u000a|<hr>What norms surround publicly identifying as LGBTQI in my host culture? How does my self-presentation "read" in my host culture's system of gendered norms and expectations?|\u000a|<hr>What is the LGBTQI community in my host city like? How is it different from the community at home?|\u000a|<hr>What on-site resources will I have if I experience any issues/concerns while I am abroad? Are there LGBTQI organizations or other resources at my host university or in my host city?|\u000a|<hr>Do I have concerns about my housing situation? (If living with a host family, consider making the housing coordinator aware that you would like a host family that has hosted LGBTQI students in the past.)|\u000a|<hr>Might I face challenges with travel and documents due to my gender presentation?|\u000a\u000aRegardless of self-identification, all students should be aware not only of local attitudes and beliefs surrounding sex and sexual identity, but also of local laws. Some countries criminalize speech as well as behavior, and you need to be well informed about matters that could affect your safety and well-being. The [[ILGA website|http://ilga.org/]] is a good resource for checking on legal regimes around the world. \u000a\u000aStudy abroad is often a time when students explore identity and selfhood. If you are not out at home and are considering being out abroad, please make doubly sure that you do your research and ensure that your safety and well-being are provided for. If you will live with a homestay family and want to be out to them, consider telling the housing coordinator in advance that you would like an LGBTQI-friendly family. You can stipulate that they keep your request confidential, including from the family.\u000a\u000aThe local LGBTQI community will likely be quite different from that in your home country. Coming to know and understand this new culture will likely be exciting and rewarding, but like any process of cultural adaptation it may also be trying at times. Learn as much as you can in advance, but also adopt the attitude that difficulties are challenges to overcome rather than merely obstacles in your way.\u000a\u000aIt may be helpful to talk with others who have studied or traveled in your host country. You may be able to take advantage of welcoming contexts on campus, such as the [[Office of LGBTQI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], to help you network with past participants. Your study abroad provider may be able to connect you with LGBTQI alumni of your specific program. Your program staff can also serve as an excellent resource both before you leave and while you're abroad.\u000a\u000aIf you would like to talk about any aspect of your program with the Global Education Office, please do not hesitate to [[contact us|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2936BD-9D45-883A-02A56AC77951A353&Link_ID=1B34B64E-9B4D-6FCE-D278333739D84B5D&pID=1&lID=5]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|Vanderbilt's [[Office of LGBTQI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], a cultural center and resource for information and support about gender and sexuality|\u000a|[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|http://ilga.org/]] provides legal information on every country, as well as news and reports on the state of LGBTQI rights around the world|\u000a|[[International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission|http://iglhrc.org/]] has extensive country-specific resources.|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG bibliography|http://overseas.iu.edu/living/glbt_biblio.shtml]], bibliography of LGBTQI literature with an international perspective|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG|http://www.rainbowsig.org/]], an organization of study abroad professionals knowledgeable about LGBTQI issues|\u000a|[[ILGA-Europe|http://www.ilga-europe.org/]], the website of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's European chapter, provides multiple resources, including a Guide to Europe|\u000a|[[Utopia|http://www.utopia-asia.com/]], an online guide to Asia-Pacific gay and lesbian resources, including legal and cultural information as well as links to country-specific resources|\u000a|[[Travel at Transgender Equality|http://transequality.org/Issues/travel.html]]: air travel tips for transgender people|\u000a|[[US passport requirements|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/gender.html]] for transgender students|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Gender roles abroad">>\u000aExpectations surrounding gender roles vary from country to country, and even within countries. Because so much of our communication with others is interpreted in terms of gender, it is helpful to learn something about gender roles in your host culture. One of the best things about study abroad is making new friends, and you will want to avoid undue friction due to misunderstanding and miscommunication.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Things to think about include:|\u000a|Americans are accustomed to having non-romantic friendships with the opposite sex. How does your host culture view opposite-sex friendships?|\u000a|<hr>If you are considering being sexually active abroad, research safe sex and birth control practices as well as attitudes toward sex outside marriage.|\u000a|<hr>What constitutes sexual harassment under local law or understanding?|\u000a|<hr>How do locals dress on the street? What might your manner of dress communicate to them about you?|\u000a\u000aWhile men studying abroad will certainly see cultural differences in their ascribed roles, it is women who will usually need to adapt most to local norms and values. North American women should be aware that they may face special sets of attitudes and assumptions.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Women may want to further research questions like these:|\u000a|In some countries (particularly Latin countries), catcalls or other forms of harassment of women might be common. Is this sort of thing likely in your host country? How will you deal with it if so?|\u000a|<hr>Are there stereotypes about North American women in particular? In many places, women from the US and Canada may be seen as "easy" or out for sexual adventure.|\u000a|<hr>What behaviors might be construed as sexual? Smiling or greeting strangers? Looking directly at others? Going out at night without a companion of the opposite sex?|\u000a\u000aIt can be useful to talk with [[study abroad alumni|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewDocument&File_ID=9604]] of your host country about what they've experienced.

V<<sidebar "Religious identity abroad">>\u000aReligion is a prominent feature of cultures around the world, even in countries that are officially atheist. During your time abroad, you will likely encounter fascinating and enriching ideas and practices. You may also experience things that challenge your notions of spiritual truth or even basic fairness. \u000a\u000aIf you plan to practice your own religion abroad, do some research first. You'll want to know whether there are convenient houses of worship, of course. But depending on where you are going, there may be safety issues to consider as well.\u000a\u000aIn some countries, there may be little commitment to religious pluralism. The state may sanction a religion. Or laws may restrict religious speech, particularly as it relates to political activism. In China, for example, it is a violation of the state constitution to use religion to "disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state."\u000a\u000aEven if the society is generally an open one, be aware that safety concerns may still exist. Just as in the US, wearing symbols of some religions or frequenting houses of worship may make you a target for passionate violence from other groups. \u000a\u000aWhatever your personal beliefs and circumstances, remember that your primary purpose is studying abroad. Consider your experiences an opportunity to understand the historical and social dimensions of religion in your host country. Be open-minded, save critical impulses for later, and open your own beliefs and practices to the same degree of scrutiny. If you approach your time in your host country as a time to learn about others' beliefs and attitudes, you can avoid many opportunities for conflict.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself|\u000a|Is there a dominant religion in my host country?|\u000a|<hr>What laws exist pertaining to religion? Are there strong societal practices that, while not codified in law, might shape religious practice?|\u000a|<hr>How tolerant is my host country of religious diversity? How tolerant am I of beliefs and practices in my host country?|\u000a|<hr>How tolerant is my host country of nonbelief (i.e. atheism, agnosticism)?|\u000a|<hr>Where can I practice my religion?|\u000a|<hr>How safe is it for me to wear symbolic expressions of my religion in public?|\u000a|<hr>How can I accommodate my dietary requirements abroad?|\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Pluralism Project|http://www.pluralism.org/reports/links]], bibliography of research and websites on world religions|\u000a|[[International Religious Freedom|http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper]], the most recent report from the US State Department on religious freedom around the world|\u000a|[[Jewish Travel Advisor|http://jewishtraveladvisor.com/]], world-wide listing of kosher hotels and restaurants, synagogues, mikvaot, and Jewish communities around the world |\u000a|[[Halal Trip|http://www.halaltrip.com/city-guide-all]], website focused on Muslim travelers and including city guides with a focus on halal dining|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Being American abroad">>\u000aIf you grew up in the US and identify as American, your American-ness will probably be the most important factor in how natives of your host country relate to you. (This is true no matter what your background.) While other components of your identity may be important factors, the fact that you are American will be a critical component of your identity abroad.\u000a\u000aBe prepared to encounter curiosity and interest. America's unique economic, political, and cultural position in the world means that people all around the world feel like they have a stake in what the US does. You may be asked all sorts of questions, from what it's like to live in America to what you think of politics and other issues in the US. (The FBI has recently warned that American students abroad may also be the target of espionage recruitment.)\u000a\u000aMost interest you receive will probably be friendly, even if frankly or passionately expressed. But do prepare yourself to encounter actual hostility as well, and to consider how you might handle it.\u000a\u000aIn many places, people may assume that because you are American, you are also rich. Or they may have other assumptions, based on media portrayals, local history with US policies or intervention, or other sources. Do some research before you go so that you can have some idea of what being an American might mean in your host country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Quick tip|\u000a|In some parts of the world, you should be careful about referring to yourself as "American." The entire Western Hemisphere is properly called America, and in Central and South America people may find the term "American" arrogant when used for just one country. Plan on referring to yourself as North American (//norteamericano/norteamericana//) instead.|\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Diversity Issues in Study Abroad|http://www.smith.edu/studyabroad/docs/diversity_st_abroad01.pdf]]: A booklet that collects statements of Brown University students about their experiences of identity abroad. A bit dated now, but many comments remain reflective of realities today.|\u000a|''A Student Guide to Study Abroad'', a guide to many aspects of the process of study abroad, is a physical volume that you are welcome to reference by visiting GEO's reading library in our Student Life Center office.|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "More on credit cards">>\u000aEurope and much of the rest of the world are moving to chip-and-PIN (or EMV) "smart" credit cards. These cards offer more secure transactions by adding an embedded microchip and replacing easily forged signatures with the entry of a PIN number.\u000a\u000aYou should be able to function abroad with a regular US swipe card, which are still accepted by most businesses. However, US swipe cards are not likely to work at most self-serve kiosks.\u000a\u000aDepending on your bank, it may be possible for you to get a chip-and-PIN card in the US for use overseas. If you decide to explore this route, be aware that there is a difference between "chip-and-PIN" and "chip-and-signature" cards. Chip-and-signature cards will not work in automated kiosks abroad, for example.\u000a\u000aRegardless of whether you choose a chip-embedded card, you may want to shop around for banks and credit card companies before you leave. Seek out cards that carry low foreign transaction fees, as well as debit card providers with overseas partnerships that allow for lower ATM fees.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Where will you live?">>

V<<sidebar "Disclosing medical information">>\u000aGEO strongly recommends that you disclose all medical and mental health conditions to your program staff. Even if you are diligent in the management of your health, studying abroad can present challenges you may not have foreseen. You or your body may react in unexpected ways. It is in your best interest to give your on-site staff the tools necessary to ensure you have a safe and successful time abroad. \u000a\u000aAny health-related history you provide is used to support your stay. It would only be shared in the case of a medical or mental health emergency--and only with the appropriate clinicians or staff on site. It will definitely //not// be used to determine your eligibility to participate in the program!\u000a\u000aYou are encouraged to discuss with your medical provider whether you should sign a Release of Information (ROI). This document would allow your doctor to discuss your medical needs with the person(s) named in the ROI. An ROI allows you to be cared for in the event that you are incapacitated and unable to grant the permission yourself.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Medical insurance">>\u005c\u000a

V<<sidebar "Coping with stress & culture shock">>\u000aCulture shock is one expression of stress, but even after culture shock passes, living and studying abroad may sometimes be stressful. Stress may be harder to manage when you are far from your normal support group of family and friends. Learn to recognize the signs of stress and take steps to cope with the situation and make yourself more resilient.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|>|>|Common signs of stress|h\u000a|exhaustion|fatigue|change in appetite|\u000a|anxiety|isolation|alienation|\u000a|frustration|extreme homesickness|increased use of nicotine, alcohol, or drugs|\u000a|loneliness|change in behavior|self-harming|\u000a|>|>|new or more frequent physical symptoms, e.g. headaches, stomachaches, etc.|\u000a\u000aOne of the best ways to combat stress in a new environment is to prepare for the new location. ''Learn as much as you can about your host city'' before you go. Read up on climate, foods, politics, culture, religion, and more. Buy a phrasebook and try to learn some of the basics of the language.\u000a\u000a''Take a step back.'' Analyze your situation and study your own reactions. Where exactly is the stress coming from? Ask yourself if cultural differences might be a contributing factor, and how you can work with or around them. Focus on what you can change or control, not on what you can't: If you can't change the situation, work on changing your reactions to it.\u000a\u000a''Take care of your body.'' Be sure that you are staying active, eating well, and getting enough sleep. Work on being positive, and be active--get out of your room.\u000a\u000a''Identify what helps you //healthfully// manage stress.'' Avoid using pills, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, overeating, undereating, or oversleeping to manage stress. Instead, focus on healthy antidotes and find the ones that work for you. Ideas include exercise, keeping a journal, regular social contact with //positive// people, hobbies, other leisure activities, or cultural activities.\u000a\u000a''Find your social support.'' Identify your support groups both locally and at home. These might include program staff, housing staff, homestay family, friends, home university staff, or family. Ask yourself who can best offer you the support you need, and then ask them for it!\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Life in a Foreign Culture|http://www.northwestern.edu/studyabroad/outbound-students/life-in-a-foreign-culture-tips-for-cultural-adjustment-while-abroad.html]], tips to ease your cultural adjustment|\u000a|[[Culture Shock, Homesickness, and the "Aha Moment"|http://thestudyabroadblog.com/culture-shock-and-homesickness/]], firsthand description of culture shock, and of both failed and successful coping|\u000a|[[Resilient Traveling|http://resilient-traveling.umich.edu/]], skills, personal stories, and resources to help you manage stress and enhance your experience abroad|\u000a|[[How Stress Affects Your Health|http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress.aspx]], info from the American Psychological Association|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Mind-Body Lab|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/pcc/mind-body-lab]], includes self-help modules for stress management|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's Psychological & Counseling Center|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/pcc/about-center]] Wherever you are in the world, the PCC can help you identify local resources.

V!Eating and diet\u000a!!!!Balancing dietary requirements with cultural exploration\u000aPeople everywhere eat differently because they //are// different--they have different cultures. Exploring another culture means exploring its food. GEO recommends that you keep an open mind, accept cultural differences, and try everything you (safely) can. Have a gastronomic adventure!\u000a\u000aIf you have dietary restrictions, eating well while fully experiencing your host culture may be a challenge. Whether you maintain your diet for medical, religious, philosophical, or other reasons, be sure to share the details with your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program staff<</if>> //before// you arrive on site. They will use this information to help identify appropriate housing/dining for you. They may also be able to research restaurants, grocery stores, and useful vocabulary.\u000a\u000aIf you have a food allergy, be very detailed in disclosing what is safe for you.  For example, if you have a nut allergy, can you be around nuts? can you eat food processed on the same equipment as nuts? are all nuts harmful for you? Let your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader, other staff, and your classmates<<else>>program and host family<</if>> know.\u000a\u000aLearn as much as you can about your host culture's food, food culture, and food vocabulary before you go. Your diet and the terms you use for it may not be well understood there, so be prepared to explain why you can\u2019t, or choose not to, eat certain foods--ideally before someone cooks you a meal.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Food|http://www.ciee.org/gap-year-abroad/downloads/school-resources/Food.pdf]], a pamphlet on "the edible part of culture"|\u000a|[[International Vegetarian Union|http://www.worldvegfest.org/]], information and recipes for vegetarians and vegans worldwide|\u000a|[[VegGuide|http://www.vegguide.org/]], a searchable guide to vegetarian restaurants worldwide|\u000a|[[SelectWisely|http://www.selectwisely.com/Resources/]], a library of links to information about traveling abroad with dietary restrictions|\u000a|[[Jewish Travel Advisor|http://jewishtraveladvisor.com/]], world-wide listing of kosher hotels and restaurants, synagogues, mikvaot, and Jewish communities around the world |\u000a|[[Halal Trip|http://www.halaltrip.com/city-guide-all]], website focused on Muslim travelers and including city guides with a focus on halal dining|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Making friends">>\u005c

V!Preparing for safety\u000a!!!!Research your destination and register your travel\u000aWhile generally not more dangerous than life in Nashville, study abroad is not a risk-free activity. You are traveling into an unfamiliar country and situation, and the most effective way to avoid problems is to plug the gaps in your knowledge.\u000a\u000aThe more you know and learn about your destination before you go, the safer you will be. Read all the program information you are given, and do your own research as well. Up-to-date commercial guidebooks are often good resources, particularly for coverage of local risks and high-crime areas. Country-specific information provided by the US Department of State and its counterparts overseas can also be helpful.\u000a\u000aKnow the local laws, and learn about behavioral norms and expectations. Outspokenness and ostentatious public behavior are not virtues in most places abroad. In some situations they may invite unwanted attention and problems. Dress in a fashion that is appropriate to cultural norms and religious sensitivities.\u000a\u000aYour main destination will be automatically registered with [[International SOS|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BSGM000066&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1]], Vanderbilt's emergency evacuation provider. But //you should also register any side trips you take while abroad.// If you are a US citizen, also register with the Department of State's [[STEP program|https://step.state.gov/step/]].\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[What are some resources for monitoring regional safety overseas?|Resources for monitoring regional safety]]\u000a   [[How does Vanderbilt minimize risks that students face abroad?|Vanderbilt\u2019s safety efforts]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u005c\u000a\u000a<<segue "Basic safety abroad">>\u005c

V!Basic safety abroad\u000a!!!!Tips for staying safe while out and about\u000aYou are the best guarantor of your own safety! While abroad, commit yourself to being an alert and observant traveler at all times. Anticipate problems by learning to read the local environment, and by knowing where and when to be hypervigilant. If you aren't paying attention, you can easily become the victim of opportunistic crime.\u000a\u000aRoad safety issues and driving accidents are the //primary// cause of injury to students abroad. Learn local traffic patterns and traffic laws, as well as safe pedestrian habits. Given the risks of traffic accidents, ''Vanderbilt does //not// recommend the rental of motor vehicles while studying abroad''.\u000a\u000a''Know where you are going and look like you belong''. Definitely bring your map along, but don't check it in the open street, where looking lost could get you robbed. Be friendly, but don't hesitate to refuse offers of help from strangers, especially near ATMs, ticket machines, train and metro stations, and baggage lines. See a [[list of common travel scams|http://www.justtheflight.co.uk/blog/16-40-tourist-scams-to-avoid-this-summer.html]].\u000a\u000a''Avoid demonstrations and political disturbances'' of all kinds. Crowd behavior is unpredictable, and even peaceful marches can turn violent.\u000a\u000a''Get a working cell phone'' and carry it with you. Some programs require students to have a phone, and most will provide you information on getting a cheap phone that works locally. A phone can be a literal lifeline in an emergency--carry one! There is more information on phones abroad later in this guide.\u000a\u000aSecure your travel and identification documents at all times, and store duplicate copies in multiple places. ''Know your local emergency numbers'', particularly for your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director and program staff<</if>>, and for the [[local equivalent of 911|$local911URL]].\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Road safety overseas|Road safety overseas]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Personal emergencies">>\u005c

V!Personal emergencies\u000a!!!!What to do after experiencing a personal emergency\u000aPersonal emergencies may arise from illness, accidents, behavioral health crises, or criminal/negligent behavior. They generally require immediate assistance, whether from a health professional, law enforcement, a counselor, or some combination of these. If you encounter a personal emergency abroad, follow these steps:\u000a\u000a''Request help immediately''. Know the local [[emergency number or numbers|$local911URL]] (911 doesn't work abroad!) and have your phone with you at all times. You may download GEO's [[wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|$emergencyCardURL]] to record information in a handy, portable format.\u000a\u000a''Notify your program's emergency contact''. <<if $facultyled>>Your faculty leader or another designated person <<else>>At least one member of your program's staff <</if>>will be available to you around the clock. On-site personnel are best positioned to provide timely and appropriate emergency support. If you are reporting an emergency on behalf of a friend, be sure to identify yourself as well as your friend.\u000a\u000aIf you are in immediate danger, or have been in a serious accident or the victim of a criminal act, ''contact law enforcement as soon as possible''. Your program staff may be in a better position to talk with law enforcement, and will also know the proper protocols. Work with them if at all possible.\u000a\u000a''Contact your insurance provider'' if the emergency requires medical attention of any kind. Depending on the nature of the emergency, it may also be appropriate to contact International SOS (ISOS). See information later in this presentation.\u000a\u000a<<if $facultyled>>''Notify your program's Vanderbilt Administrator''. A direct notification from you may help coordinate support services. For example, your administator may be able to provide additional assistance or help streamline communications.\u000a\u000a<<display "Faculty-Led Administration">>\u005c\u000a\u000a<<else>>''Notify the Vanderbilt Global Education Office''. A direct notification from you will help us coordinate support services. We can often provide additional assistance or help streamline communications.\u000a\u000a<</if>>''Contact the nearest embassy''. Consular agents at US embassies are available 24/7 to help US citizens with emergencies. If you are not a US citizen, contact both the US embassy and your home country's embassy.\u000a\u000a''Contact your family''. Your family will be anxious and concerned about your well-being. Your program staff <<if not $facultyled>>and GEO are both<<else>>are<</if>> limited in the information they can share, so be sure to communicate with your family directly.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Large-scale emergencies">>\u005c

V!Large-scale emergencies\u000a!!!!Procedures for dealing with large-scale disaster\u000aLarge-scale emergencies take many forms. Massive accidents, civil strife, acts of terrorism, natural disasters.... They are hard to predict and proper response depends heavily on local circumstances. \u000a\u000aIn general, your <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>program staff<</if>> will brief you soon after arrival on emergency protocols. (If they don't, take responsibility for your own safety and ask them!) Local emergency plans typically include the following elements:\u005c\u000a\u000a*a pre-established location where students and staff will assemble after a large-scale disaster;\u000a*communications protocols designed to account for all program participants;\u000a*an evacuation plan;\u000a*contingency plans short of full evacuation.\u005c\u000a\u000aThe most important general advice that Vanderbilt can offer is this: ''Know the protocols of your <<if $facultyled>>program's<<else>>site's<</if>> emergency plan.'' Keep calm, follow those protocols, and act with common sense and your best knowledge of the local situation.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling independently or are unable to reach your rally point, contact International SOS (ISOS). Vanderbilt contracts with ISOS to provide emergency services around the globe. They can provide you with information as well as direct aid. See the information on the next page.\u000a\u000aDownload a [[wallet-sized emergency contacts card|$emergencyCardURL]] to record information in a handy, portable format.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[FAQ on the US Department of State's role in crises overseas|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/crisis-support.html]]|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's ISOS portal|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BSGM000066]], includes contact information|\u000a|[[GEO's wallet-sized emergency contacts directory|$emergencyCardURL]], fill it out and carry it with you|\u000a\u000a<<segue "International SOS">>\u005c

V!International SOS\u000a!!!!Emergency and travel assistance for Vanderbilt students\u000aVanderbilt requires that all students traveling on Vanderbilt programs register their travel with International SOS (ISOS). ''GEO registers you automatically'' for your primary study abroad program. You should log in to Vanderbilt's ISOS portal (see below) to register any side trips you take while abroad, or time you spend abroad before or after your program. GEO will remind you to do this and link to instructions, but the responsibility is yours.\u000a\u000aVanderbilt contracts with ISOS primarily to handle responses to major emergencies overseas. ISOS also offers other services, and as a Vanderbilt student, you have access to all of them. But you should be aware that //not all are free// to you.\u000a\u000aThe primary role of ISOS is to aid in ''response to large-scale disasters and crises''. For example, during the "Arab Spring," ISOS evacuated a Vanderbilt student from Egypt. The organization runs a worldwide network of centers, clinics, and ambulances to deal with ill or wounded people. If you use ISOS in such an emergency, Vanderbilt will cover the cost.\u000a\u000aISOS can also help you with medical, personal, security, legal, or travel problems. Examples might include dealing with a lost passport, a critical missed airline connection, medical help, or other issues. ISOS provides these services on a fee-for-service basis (it is //not// a health or travel insurer). While Vanderbilt will likely cover the up-front charges in non-emergency circumstances, ''you may be billed for these services after the fact.'' \u000a\u000aISOS also offers excellent safety information both on its [[Vanderbilt web portal|$isosURL]] and via emailed updates. You'll need to [[sign up for email updates|https://www.travelsecurity.com/Alerts.aspx?MembershipNo=11BSGM000066&Colour=cccccc&Logo=https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/images/ClientAssets/logos/182_logo.jpg]] yourself (it's quick and painless). Consider downloading the [[ISOS contact card|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/images/ClientAssets/CustomPrintCards/182_CustomPrintCard.pdf]] from the web portal, or use GEO's [[wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|$emergencyCardURL]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's ISOS portal|$isosURL]], registration instructions, up-to-date risk ratings, downloadable ISOS card, and travel security advisories.|\u000a|[[ISOS email update signup|https://www.travelsecurity.com/Alerts.aspx?MembershipNo=11BSGM000066&Colour=cccccc&Logo=https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/images/ClientAssets/logos/182_logo.jpg]], enter your email address for email updates related to your travel destination(s)|\u000a|[[ISOS contact card|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/images/ClientAssets/CustomPrintCards/182_CustomPrintCard.pdf]], including 24/7 phone number and membership number|\u000a|[[GEO's wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|$emergencyCardURL]] is designed to be filled out and carried on your person|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Road safety overseas">>\u000aMovies and media reporting have conditioned us to think that the greatest threats to safety abroad are dramatic, "foreign," and of the "third world." The reality is that the ''number one cause of injury and death for American students abroad is traffic accidents''. And the vast majority of these occur in wealthy, industrialized countries.\u000a\u000aGEO suggests that you train yourself to pay maximum attention at all times. Avoid earbuds as well as drinking--both can impair perception! Know the basic patterns of traffic, and remember to pay attention to the right side of the road in countries where traffic flow is reversed!\u000a\u000aAvoid traveling late at night, and always choose the safest form of transportation available. If you have a choice between riding in a taxicab or on the roof of a crowded bus--choose the cab! If walking is your safest option, do that whenever possible.\u000a\u000aJust as in the US, you should always wear a seatbelt. Avoid riding with anyone who appears intoxicated, over-tired, or emotionally distraught. Always sit in the back seat of a taxi.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries present other risks, including shady taxi drivers, unsafe vehicles, overcrowded transport, and more. Your program staff will provide you with information about your options and help you assess risk. Don't be afraid to ask questions! \u000a\u000a''Vanderbilt strongly advises against renting a vehicle while abroad.'' Cars, SUVs, motorcycles, and mopeds are equally poor choices. The risks of driving when the rules of the road are unfamiliar are just too great.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Road Safety Overseas|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html]], US Department of State|\u000a|[[Country-specific information from US Department of State|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html]], includes information on road safety for every country in the world|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Personal emergencies">>\u005c

Intoxication is a factor is the major factor in injuries and deaths experienced by American students abroad. Physical and mental impairment also make it difficult for you to take precautions for your own safety--including your sexual well-being.\u000a\u000aIf you do drink, do so in moderation. Be careful what you consume, and always watch your drink to avoid having it spiked with a dangerous substance. \u000a\u000aRemember that your behavior is subject to local laws, to policies set by your program provider and/or university, //and// to [[Vanderbilt policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcohol/]]. Laws governing controlled substances may differ greatly from those in your home country, and it is your responsibility to be aware. Public intoxication is always inappropriate, may be illegal, and can lead to serious--even fatal--consequences.\u000a\u000aIf you are uncertain about specific policies or laws abroad, please consult with a local program representative.

V<<sidebar "Your legal status in your host country">>\u000aMany US citizens are under the impression that their US passport acts as a "get out of jail free" card overseas. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever your nationality, if you are arrested, you will be subject to the entire foreign legal process--including imprisonment. Neither Vanderbilt or your government can do anything to get you out of prison!\u000a\u000aKnow the laws of your host country! Be aware that conditions in foreign jails and prisons may be very different from those in your home country. The legal system will also be difficult to understand and navigate. Your home country's consular officials can provide a wide array of services, but they //cannot extricate you from the situation//.\u000a\u000aDrug arrests can be particularly bad in many places. Harsh sentences, no bail, and dire conditions characterize many countries. Know the local laws and think twice before making a jail stay part of your time abroad.

V!Sexual misconduct abroad\u000a!!!!Regardless of local law, Vanderbilt policies apply\u000aSocial norms--and civil and criminal laws--vary from country to country.  Even so, Vanderbilt\u2019s policies, including the university\u2019s Student Accountability and Sexual Misconduct and Power-Based Violence policies, apply in all study abroad programs in which Vanderbilt students participate, whether those programs are administered by Vanderbilt or a third party.  Vanderbilt students, faculty and staff participating in study abroad programs must comply with local laws, the rules and regulations of their study abroad program, and with Vanderbilt\u2019s policies.\u000a\u000aIf you are a victim of sexual misconduct while abroad, contact the <<if $facultyled>>faculty leader<<else>>resident director<</if>> of your program for help. If you are unable or unwilling to discuss the issue with program staff, please contact Vanderbilt's [[Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/]] (EAD) or [[Project Safe|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/]]. Project Safe has someone available around the clock every day of the year. The Student Handbook\u2019s [[policy on Sexual Misconduct|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]] identifies confidential resources (see also [[Project Safe|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/manage/wp-content/uploads/VU-Resource-List-2013.pdf]]).\u000a\u000aThe range of sanctions for violations of Vanderbilt\u2019s Student Accountability and Sexual Misconduct and Power-Based Violence Policies are set forth in the Student Handbook. Individuals who engage in gender-based or sexual misconduct--or other forms of misconduct--may also be subject to local laws, and the civil and criminal consequences may be severe.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[VU Student Accountability Policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/student-conduct/]], from the Student Handbook|\u000a|[[Sexual Misconduct and Other Forms of Power-Based Violence Policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]], from the Student Handbook|\u000a|[[VU Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/]]|\u000a|[[VU Project Safe|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/]] will research local resources when a student needs in-person advocacy or support, wherever they are--including abroad.|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt Sexual Assault Support and Resources List|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/projectsafe/manage/wp-content/uploads/VU-Resource-List-2013.pdf]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Grades and credits">>\u005c

Whether you capitalize on what your program offers or create your own opportunities, taking steps to make the most of your time overseas//will//pay off.\u000a\u000aThe study abroad alumni profiled below pursued research, internships, volunteering, and cultural experiences that have led to better career preparation, improved self-knowledge, and more advanced cross-cultural skills. How will //you// engage?\u000a\u000a!!!!I volunteered with Starfish, a service organization for trafficked women\u000aWhile studying in Beijing, I volunteered with the Starfish Project, a service organization that works with previously trafficked women. Starfish teaches vocational skills and provides continuing education and health care access. I taught English. Our English Corner, a regular group discussion in both Chinese and English on a variety of topics, gave me a fantastic opportunity to be involved in the exchange of cultures. Coming back to Vanderbilt, I decided to put more effort into immersing myself at home as well: I teach Spanish at the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, tutor in Chinese, and am looking forward to a future with strong connections to the global community.\u000a\u000aOmega Tennant\u000aCET Beijing, Spring 2013\u000aMajor: Human & Organizational Development\u000a\u000a!!!!I prepared for the experience I wanted to have--and interned at the Vienna State Opera\u000a\u000aI wanted to go to Vienna, but I knew I'd get much more out of it if I knew the language. So I went to summer language school beforehand, and with that grasp of German I was able to make local friends and attend Universitt Wien. When I somehow managed to become the (first-ever!) intern at the Vienna State Opera, it was a dream come true. In addition to learning the art and business of opera at one of the most important cultural institutions in the world, I got to see Austrian work and daily life from the inside. I fell in love with Vienna, and will be returning after graduation to make a life there.\u000a\u000aNora Pertz\u000aIES Vienna, Spring 2014\u000aMajors: Piano Performance, European Studies\u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Maintaining your eligibility to study abroad">>\u000aTo maintain your eligibility to study abroad you must ''remain in good standing'' with the University. You must also ''complete all Vanderbilt study abroad'' requirements. Regardless of why you are removed from a program, ''you will be responsible for any fees that accompany late withdrawal''. Fees will be billed through your Vanderbilt student account.\u000a\u000aGEO checks Vanderbilt students' academic, disciplinary, and financial standing when you apply to a program. We also check late in the semester or summer before you leave for your abroad program. If you fall out of good standing, we will consult with your academic dean and, if necessary, withdraw you from your abroad program. <<if $vanderbilt>>(Visiting students may be withdrawn at the request of the home university.)<</if>>\u000a\u000aYour eligibility also depends on completing all of the items listed in your GEO account (see below). If you fail to complete any of these required items,  we may be forced to revoke your permission to study abroad. \u000a\u000aHere's how that would work: As the <<if $maymester>>withdrawal deadline<<else>>end of the term<</if>> draws near, GEO will warn you at least twice in writing, directing all emails to your Vanderbilt email address. Your final warning will also be copied to your dean's office. If the requirements are not complete by the day specified in your final warning email, we will remove you from the program.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Examples of requirements|\u000a|Program Release Form|\u000a|GEO Survival Guide|\u000a|Mandatory Health Assessment|\u000a|Withdrawal Policy|\u000a|<hr>//Requirements may vary by program.

V<<sidebar "Traveling with a musical instrument">>\u000aAir travel with a musical instrument can present special challenges. Many instruments are larger than the typical carry-on bag, and some are irregularly shaped. Certain instruments are fragile, exceptionally valuable, or contain protected materials. Here are some things to consider as you decide whether and how to bring your instrument.\u000a\u000aIf you have a large instrument, or a very valuable one, you may want to check into options for ''renting an instrument'' rather than dealing with transport. Contact your program provider or GEO to see whether renting is a viable option. \u000a\u000aThe airline you choose may greatly affect your transportation options. Check their ''guidelines for checked and carry-on baggage''. Some airlines allow 1-2 checked bags for no charge, while others charge even for a single checked bag. If your instrument is too large, you may be able to ''buy a seat next to you''. <<if $semester>>If you receive financial assistance, you may want to check with the Office of Financial Aid to see whether help might be available to cover the second seat.<</if>>\u000a\u000aOn full flights, airlines may require that carry-on items be checked. Arriving early to get through security and/or paying for advance boarding may help avoid this situation. But even if you plan to carry on your instrument, it is wise to ''pack it as though it will be checked''.\u000a\u000a''Pack your instrument'' in a hard-sided case with padding around it;  foam, bubble wrap, newspapers, and t-shirts work well as packing materials. Put a tag with your name, permanent address, and phone number both outside and inside your case. Include short instructions in case a security officer is handling and repacking your instrument.\u000a\u000aIt is also vitally important that you check to see if your instrument contains any [[protected materials|https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/factsheet-musical-instruments-2014.pdf]] such as Brazilian rosewood, elephant ivory, tortoiseshell or other rare plant or animal material. Some materials require [[special documentation or a permit|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips.html]], and if carrying them you must travel through [[specific ports|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips/designated-ports-of-entry-exit.html]].\u000a\u000aBefore you make final decisions about bringing a large instrument, you may want to check with your program provider to see what options you will have for ''instrument storage''. \u000a\u000a<<<\u000a''Predeparture checklist''\u000a\u000a<ul class="checklist">\u005c\u000a<li><<smartcheckbox "$todo.instrumentProtected">>Check whether your instrument contains [[protected materials|https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/factsheet-musical-instruments-2014.pdf]] that require [[special documentation, a permit|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips.html]], or travel through [[specific ports|http://americanorchestras.org/advocacy-government/travel-with-instruments/endangered-species-material/protected-species-travel-tips/designated-ports-of-entry-exit.html]].</li>\u000a<li><<smartcheckbox "$todo.instrumentStorage">>Inquire with your program provider about storing your instrument safely while abroad.
