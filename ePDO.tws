V<<sidebar "Vanderbilt policy on alcohol abroad">>\u000aVanderbilt does not really treat alcohol use abroad any differently than it does on campus. However, in all of the countries where Vanderbilt has approved study abroad programs, the drinking age is lower than it is here in Nashville. You need to abide by the legal drinking age of the country you're in. Remember that violations of law overseas may also become grounds for disciplinary action both at Vanderbilt and under the rules of your abroad program.\u000a\u000aAt the same time that you are considering the legal implications of drinking, be mindful of cultural norms surrounding alcohol use in your host country. In many countries, for example, American-style "binge drinking" may appear pathological or merely pathetic. Take the opportunity to see cultural practices in a new light. \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!The Student Handbook says:|\u000a|Students are required to abide by the laws of the respective countries in which they reside, study, or travel, with respect to the age at which alcoholic beverages may be consumed. Otherwise, the policies with respect to [[alcoholic beverages and controlled substances|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcohol/]] included in the Vanderbilt //Student Handbook// apply. Students are subject to student-accountability sanctions, including expulsion, and referral for prosecution for violation of these policies.|\u000a|<hr>//From// [[VU Student Handbook, Study Abroad|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/university-policies-regulations/#study-abroad]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Grades and credits">>\u005c

V!Student status and billing\u000a!!!!You remain a Vanderbilt student while abroad!\u000aWhile studying abroad, you ''remain registered as a Vanderbilt student'' and you retain access to on-campus resources. You can register for classes, log in to YES and other campus applications, and make use of services (including [[counseling|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/pcc/]]).\u000a<<if $facultyled neq "true">> \u000aTo make this possible, GEO enrolls you in a study abroad &ldquo;''placeholder course''.&rdquo; The placeholder will appear on your YES account before you go abroad. The actual courses you take abroad, as well as the grades you earned, will eventually replace the placeholder. This will occur only after your transcript arrives from abroad and both GEO and the University Registrar have processed it. ''It may take 2 to 6 months'' from the end of your program for your transcript to arrive, depending on individual circumstances.<</if>>\u000a\u000a''Billing'' works just as it does for on-campus students. Vanderbilt Student Accounts will bill you, and your bill will arrive at the same time as usual, with the same payment terms. You can find the fees for your program in GEO's [[Cost Calculator|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=B6A18B3E-FF30-D2BF-DB945C58C1748491&Link_ID=A02DB6D2-A969-AD00-E852344EC0D31EA1&pID=5&lID=33]].

V!Conduct and law\u000a!!!!Be a good ambassador\u000aWhile you are abroad, be an ambassador for both Vanderbilt and your home country. You are part of a worldwide web of interactions, and the impression you make on the people of your host country reflects on where you came from!\u000a\u000aTake some time to learn about norms in the country you're visiting so that you can attempt to blend in socially. Beyond that, treat those you meet courteously and with sensitivity toward cultural differences. Remember, you are in their world!\u000a\u000aMoreover, you are ''subject to local laws'' while you are abroad. Foreign laws and legal systems may be quite different from those in your home country, and you need to know the differences. If you break local laws while abroad, neither Vanderbilt nor the U.S. Embassy can get you out of jail.\u000a<<if ($vanderbilt neq "true") or ($facultyled neq "true")>>\u000aWhether you are studying abroad at a university or on a smaller program with one of GEO's partners, you must also ''follow that institution's rules and policies''. These institutions may sanction or dismiss you if you violate their rules. //Dismissal from an abroad program will have the same consequences for your GPA and four-year plan as a dismissal from Vanderbilt!//<</if>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Vanderbilt conduct policies">>\u005c

V!Course equivalency evaluations\u000a!!!!Making sure your courses count for Vanderbilt credit\u000aEvery course you take abroad needs to be evaluated by Vanderbilt faculty to earn Vanderbilt credit. This process determines how the course will count at Vanderbilt--or if it will count at all.\u000a\u000aThe single most important thing to remember about course equivalency evaluations is that ''you are responsible''! GEO facilitates the process, but it falls on you to ensure that your courses get evaluated for credit.

V!Grades and Credits\u000a!!!!You're earning Vanderbilt credit abroad\u000aCourses you take on programs offered through GEO earn you ''direct Vanderbilt credit''. This means that your grades will appear on your Vanderbilt transcript and will factor into your GPA, almost exactly as if you had taken them at VU.\u000a\u000aJust as at Vanderbilt, you must take the equivalent of 12-18 hours of credit. Courses taken on GEO programs can count toward majors and minors, or as hours toward graduation. However, they //do not// count toward AXLE requirements.\u000a\u000aStudy abroad courses come with some special rules:\u000a#You cannot take courses pass/fail. \u000a#You cannot retake classes abroad that you have already taken on campus (and vice versa). If you do take a course abroad that is equivalent to a course you've already taken on campus, you may well get //no credit// for it!\u000a#You cannot opt out of a course you took abroad. Withdraw from courses you don't want to take during the drop/add period!\u000a#Vanderbilt cannot change the grade you earned abroad. If a grade is incorrect, work with your program provider abroad to get it changed and to issue a new transcript.\u000a#You must monitor prerequisites and other requirements for courses you take abroad. Consult with your VU academic advisor, but understand that ultimately you are responsible for taking appropriate courses abroad!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Academics Abroad">>\u000a   [[How might academic systems abroad differ from Vanderbilt?|Academic systems abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Course equivalency evaluations">>\u005c

V!Tips for packing\u000a!!!!Pack light and pack smart!\u000aIn GEO's experience, students experience two primary difficulties with packing: They bring too much stuff, and they often don't plan well enough for their specific destination. Here are some tips to help!\u000a\u000a''Research your location's climate'' and the prevailing weather patterns for the time you will be there, and pack accordingly! Wikipedia is a good source for basic climate data on nearly every city in the world (just search for your city), but commercial guidebooks are probably the single best source of information. \u000a\u000a''Bring only //one// suitcase'' that you can lift and maneuver without help. If you bring a backpack as your carry-on, it can double as a weekend travel bag.\u000a\u000a''Consider bringing a light duffel bag'' that you can fold up and put in your large suitcase. You may need it to carry the things you buy abroad!\u000a\u000aOnly ''pack wardrobe pieces that are interchangeable'' and are good for layering. If it can\u2019t be used to make multiple outfits, it doesn\u2019t belong in your suitcase!

V!Passport and Document Security\u000a!!!!Keep your passport and other key documents safe\u000aWhen you are abroad, no single document is more important than your passport. Without it, ''you will not be able to cross international borders'', and other tasks--such as transferring funds--may also be made difficult or impossible. Losing your passport can be a major headache, and might even cost you thousands of dollars in airfare for missed flights. Do everything you can to keep it safe!\u000a\u000aIn general, you should only keep your passport on your person when you are traveling across borders. Otherwise, ''find a safe place for it and leave it there.'' Make a photocopy and carry that on you when you are out and about.\u000a<img src="images/passport wallet.jpg" class="right" style="height: 250px;" />\u005c\u000a\u000aIf you must carry your passport with you, keep it in a special ''passport wallet'' under your clothes.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!(Potentially) Good Places to Keep Your Passport|\u000a|Hidden in the room of your homestay or residence hall|\u000a|In your hotel's safe (//not// the room safe)|\u000a|With your study abroad provider, if they offer such a service|\u000a|<hr>//In some situations, even these options may not be secure.

V<<sidebar "How to Get a Travel Visa">>\u000aA ''travel visa'' is not a credit card! It's a stamp or sticker placed in your passport that allows you to visit a foreign country. Depending on your own nationality and your reasons for traveling, ''you may or may not need a visa'' to enter a given country.\u000a\u000aIf you will be taking classes from an institution based in your host country, you will usually need a student-class visa to enter. Entry requirements are often lower when you are simply visiting as a tourist. \u000a\u000aRequirements to get a visa may include photographs, financial information, a letter from your host university, a criminal background check, or even a personal appearance at the foreign consulate. Your own nationality may have a major impact on the requirements you face in getting a visa. For example, US citizens typically face lower barriers than students of other nationalities. \u000a\u000aIn certain cases, students may be able to enter a country without a visa, but will need to obtain a ''residence permit'' after entering.\u000a\u000aYour study abroad provider will inform you about your visa requirements.

V!Traveling while abroad\u000a!!!!Important things to keep in mind when planning travel\u000aFirst, always ''keep your Resident Director or staff informed'' of your travel. Also keep your family in the loop; if there is an emergency back home, they will want to know how get in touch with you!\u000a\u000aSome countries that you plan to visit may have different entry requirements than your primary host country. ''Investigate all the countries you're interested in'' before you leave the US. If any require a visa, it will probably be easier to get the visa while you're in the US (this applies to both international students and US citizens)!\u000a\u000aIn every country you visit, make a point of knowing where your ''home country's nearest embassy or consulate'' is. You want to know where you can find support if you get into real trouble. (If you're a US citizen, you should bookmark the [[list of US embassies around the world|http://www.usembassy.gov/]].)\u000a\u000aFinally, independent travel is one of the ''most expensive activities'' you can undertake abroad. Be sure to budget appropriately, and remember to consider safety while you're on the lookout for ways to travel on the cheap!\u000a<div class="talkbox">\u005c\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Wisdom from alums|\u000a|Every year, students tell us that while they loved the traveling they did abroad, they also regretted not getting to know their host city better.

V<<sidebar "Getting or Renewing a Passport">>\u000aTo get a new passport, or to renew an old one, you will need to contact the proper issuing authority for your home country.\u000a\u000aUS citizens should visit the State Department's website for [[passport services|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports.html]] to view requirements and to check on [[current processing times|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/processing-times.html]].

V!Traveling with medications\u000a!!!!Ensure continuity in your medical care\u000aDrugs that are regularly prescribed in the US can sometimes be more restricted abroad. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be interdicted overseas. Take precautions when traveling to ensure that your medications don't get you in trouble.\u000a\u000a''Keep all of your medications in their original packaging'' when traveling. This will trigger less suspicion from customs agents and law enforcement.\u000a\u000aTo find out if any of your medications are restricted or banned in your host country, [[contact the country's embassy|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]]. Ask about over-the-counter drugs too if they are a part of your regular care regime.\u000a\u000aWhatever the legal status of your medications, ''request a letter from your physician'' explaining why the drugs you are transporting have been prescribed to you. Also include over-the-counter drugs if needed. You will want to take this letter with you //whenever you travel!// Request that your doctor use the local brand names or generic/chemical names for your drugs.\u000a\u000aWhen possible, ''take enough medicine with you to cover your entire stay abroad''. If your medicine is only available in limited supply, please discuss with your physician and program staff how you will obtain enough  for your stay. \u000a\u000aBe aware that medications ''cannot be sent through the mail!''\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[MedlinePlus|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]], information on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including generic/chemical names|\u000a|[[HTH Drug Translation Guide|https://www.hthstudents.com/drug/index1.cfm]], offers equivalent brand names and availability for frequently visited countries/destinations|\u000a|[[Directory of Foreign Embassies|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]], US Department of State|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Tips for packing">>\u005c

V!Communicating with home\u000a!!!!Striking a balance\u000aYou will need to strike an appropriate balance between the folks back home and your new life abroad. Your family wants to know you are safe and having a good time, and your friends want to keep in touch--so don\u2019t cut them off completely!\u000a\u000aAt the same time, be careful not to spend //all// your time chatting back home. Constant contact might be tempting, but will ultimately make culture shock harder to bear and prevent you from experiencing your host country to the fullest. Our suggestion for keeping a healthy balance: get out and explore, make new friends, and set up a weekly schedule for contacting home.\u000a\u000aAlso keep your experiences in perspective when you call home. What you report from abroad can seem much more serious to family who aren't around to assess the situation for themselves. Beware of venting; you don\u2019t want to alarm anyone if you are only battling a head cold! Work with your on-site staff to remedy problems, and make sure your family knows you are safe and happy.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Phones and internet abroad|Phones and internet abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Disabilities and accommodations">>

V!Money\u000a!!!!Use debit and credit cards wisely to save money\u000aThe amount of money you spend while studying abroad will vary depending on the local cost of living, your personal spending habits, independent travel, and so on. //How// you access your money can also play a role in maintaining your budget.\u000a\u000aMany businesses will not accept plastic, especially for smaller purchases, so it's a good idea to have ''cash'' on hand throughout your time abroad. The most cost-effective way to get cash abroad is to use your ''debit card'' (not a credit card!) in an ATM. You can usually find out where the ATMs you might need are before you leave the US--ask your bank how!\u000a\u000aGEO also recommends that you bring a ''credit card''. Be aware that every credit card purchase or debit card withdrawal will likely carry transaction fees. Shop around a bit for the best rates before you leave the US, but also minimize the number of times you use your cards. Take out as much cash as you feel comfortable with each time you use the ATM, and use your credit card only when necessary or when you have an especially large purchase.\u000a\u000aBefore you depart the US, and every time you enter a new country, you should inform your bank(s) of your location. If you don't, you may find your cards canceled as an anti-fraud measure! \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Summary|\u000a|Before you leave, consider seeking out the US banks with the best currency conversion and transaction fees for your host country.|\u000a|Call your bank(s) to let them know you'll be abroad, and whenever you cross international borders.|\u000a|Use your debit card in an ATM to get cash on a weekly or biweekly basis.|\u000a|Use your credit card for purchases.

V<<sidebar "Basics of Budgeting">>\u000aBudgeting can be crucial to ensuring you have enough money to fund your study abroad experience. There are really two levels of budgeting that you need to keep in mind.\u000a\u000aFirst is the ''overall budget for your study abroad experience''. Getting a ballpark figure for this will help you and your family determine an appropriate monthly budget for you while you are abroad. Be sure to include not only the costs that are billed through Vanderbilt, but also the clear, fixed costs that you will pay out of pocket. Examples include: passport fees, visa fees, airfare, luggage fees, and purchase of clothing or other travel needs.\u000a\u000aTo this, you need to add an estimate of what you will spend on living expenses and entertainment and enrichment activities. This can be tricky to estimate, especially because a sudden change in currency exchange rates can alter it substantially. GEO offers rough estimates in our cost calculator, but your program provider can give you a better idea of your costs on the ground. You can also use online cost of living calculators (see Resources section below). \u000a\u000aNow that you have a blanket estimate of costs, you and your family can determine how much you should aim to spend per month. Here is where you will need to figure out how to maintain your month-to-month budget while you are abroad. \u000a\u000aA ''month-to-month budget'' is a detailed plan of the money you plan to spend, divided into categories: so much for food, so much for travel, and so on. You may need to revise it as you go. For example, you may overspend one month and need to cut back on future months. Keep in mind that students often spend more money the first few weeks while becoming acquainted with the new surroundings.

You need to learn who are your best resources, as well as figure out the most convenient methods of communication within your host country and back home.\u000a\u000aYour ''Resident Director'' will be your most reliable contact person: he or she is knowledgeable about the program, the host country, and the city--and he/she is //right there!// Whether you have a basic question, a scheduling conundrum, or you are in the midst of an emergency, your Resident Director and on-site staff should be the ''first people you contact.'' You will find out more about who your contact(s) should be in your program-specific predeparture orientation.\u000a\u000a''Remember this:'' Problems will be resolved faster if you work with someone who is on the ground with you, rather than contacting someone back home who is a few time zones and thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Hm...">>\u000a   [[When should I contact GEO?|When should I contact GEO]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Balancing Contact">>

V<<sidebar "Where to Find Crucial Information About Your Medications">>\u000aThere are two pieces of information that it will be useful or even critical for you to know about your medications: the legal status of the drug in your host country, and the generic/chemical name and/or the local brand names it goes by.\u000a\u000aTo ''find the generic or chemical name'' of a drug, you can check the National Institutes of Health's [[MedlinePlus website|http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html]]. It may be somewhat trickier to find out the brand name the drug might be sold under in your host country, but [[this tool from HTH Worldwide Insurance|https://www.hthstudents.com/drug/index1.cfm]] will provide answers in most cases.\u000a\u000aTo ''find out if any of your medications are restricted or banned'' in your host country, contact the country's embassy here in the US. The US Department of State provides a [[directory of foreign embassies|http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm]]. Even some over-the-counter drugs may be more restricted abroad, so ask if you have doubts.\u000a\u000aWhatever the legal status of your medications, ''request a letter from your physician'' explaining why the drugs you are transporting have been prescribed to you. Also include over-the-counter drugs if needed. You will want to take this letter with you //whenever you travel!// Request that your doctor use the local brand names or generic/chemical names for your drugs.\u000a\u000aWhen possible, ''take enough medicine with you to cover your entire stay abroad''. If your medicine is only available in limited supply, please discuss with your physician and program staff how you will obtain enough  for your stay.

In an emergency, you may not be able to relay information that is critical to your care. //Please// ''disclose any physical or mental health conditions'' to your program staff prior to arrival. You can use the program's medical history form, or send an email detailing your history and current care plan.\u000a\u000aLearn the generic names and legal status of any ''prescription medications'' you take //before// you leave the US.

V!Culture shock\u000a!!!!The process of adjusting to a new culture\u000aStudy abroad is an amazing time in the lives of students. However, it is natural to have difficulty adjusting to a new culture. We call the feelings associated with this adaptation process "culture shock," and they take a variety of forms. These may include homesickness, sadness, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and more.\u000a\u000aCulture shock is usually not sudden or "shocking." Instead, it is part of a continuum of feelings. Usually, there is a period of excitement when you first arrive--there is so much to see and do! Feelings of culture shock typically come soon after. The good news is that culture shock is temporary. Nearly all students will, after a few weeks, adjust to and thrive in their new surroundings.\u000a\u000aHow long culture shock lasts and how difficult it is, of course, differs depending on the person. If you are having a hard time adjusting, especially if others on your program seem to be doing fine, reach out to your resident staff or director to explain what you are feeling.\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that you will likely experience a similar adjustment period when you return home and back to Vanderbilt. Students often tell us that this "shock" is harder than going abroad. \u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[How should I cope with culture shock or other stress abroad?|Coping with stress and culture shock]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Illness abroad">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Going Abroad...Again!">>\u000aStudents who return from abroad often feel they need to go abroad again!\u000a\u000aIf you are not graduating and you have room in your academic schedule, you are welcome to ''apply for another GEO study abroad program''--there is no rule that says you can only go once! Or, if you are more strapped for time, consider ''volunteering abroad''! You can go over break either with OACS or on your own. You may even be able to find funding (ask OACS about the Nichols Humanitarian Fund!).\u000a\u000aOr consider ''graduate studies abroad''. Several universities around the world welcome international students for graduate degrees. Many have more reasonable tuition fees than you will find in the US, yet with a comparable quality of education. It is often possible to apply US federal financial aid toward studies at recognized institutions. Some countries, like the United Kingdom, will even give you a 1- or 2-year work visa upon completion of an advanced degree in their country.\u000a\u000aAnother option might be ''working or interning abroad'', including teaching English abroad. Visit GEO's [[Career page|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2A18AE-0A6B-2220-EA57131A558B072C&Link_ID=1B3AFB7F-CCFB-5B8C-F4E22E5CBC34F1E5&pID=2&lID=21]] for resources and tips for finding an international job!\u000a\u000a<<segue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

V!Opportunities for returned students\u000a!!!!There's sooooo much you can do when you get home!\u000aYour study abroad experience doesn't have to end when you return to the US! In fact, our goal is to ensure that you can extend and process your experience when you return home.\u000a\u000aGEO offers programming specifically created for returning students. We sponsor a ''student organization,'' the Study Abroad Alumni Group, which hosts social dinners and workshops. Our [[annual conference|http://vanderbi.lt/icgrsa]] helps you unpack your experience and/or share your newfound insights about the world with fellow students.\u000a\u000aWhen you return, you can also ''volunteer with or work for GEO''; it's a great way to share your experience with other students. You can also get involved in our own local community: you may be surprised how international Nashville really is!\u000a\u000aStudying abroad can make you a great candidate for ''prestigious honors scholarships'' when you return home. Some of these, such as the Fulbright Fellowship or Critical Language Summer Institutes, may even send you abroad again! These opportunities may require advance planning, though, so we encourage you to study the offerings and discuss your interests with the [[Office of Honor Scholarships|http://ohs.vanderbilt.edu]] //before you leave//.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[More ideas and resources for getting involved after you return!|Returnee resources]]\u000a   [[What possibilities exist for me to go abroad again after I return?|Going abroad again]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Ethical Photography Abroad">>\u000aAs a representative of Vanderbilt, your home country, and the global community at large, you have a responsibility to follow ethical and respectful photography practices. Be mindful of the message your final product sends as well as the impact it has on the host culture.\u000a\u000aDefinitely ''get permission'' to photograph human subjects: There are cultures where people consider photography rude or a violation of modesty, or believe that the camera can be harmful to health. And in all cultures there are people who just don't like to be photographed! Don't be afraid to ask for permission, though, or let it stop you from shooting. Instead consider asking for permission as opportunity to make a connection, have a conversation, and to demonstrate your interest in the people of your host country!\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself before you snap that picture|\u000a|Does the photo make fun of the culture or people of my host country?|\u000a|Does this picture tell a false story about my host country or its people?|\u000a|Does the subject mind that I'm photographing them?|\u000a|What message does this photo send about how I spent my time abroad?|\u000a\u000a''More resources:''\u000a[[Guidelines for Culturally Sensitive Photography|http://www.culturosity.com/pdfs/CulturallySensitivePhotography.pdf]]\u000a[[Breaking Free from the Viewfinder|http://www.melibeeglobal.com/2012/09/photography-while-on-study-abroad-breaking-free-from-the-viewfinder/]]\u000a\u000a<<segue "What to do next">>\u005c

V!Reverse culture shock\u000a!!!!Be prepared for coming home to be a bumpy ride\u000aIt may seem like a distant reality now, but part of the study abroad experience is returning home. There are many students who tell GEO that this is harder than expected, and often harder than going abroad to begin with!\u000a\u000aLook, reverse culture shock is a fact. Returning home after a significant period of time abroad is in some ways just like going abroad. You have changed, your perceptions have changed, and you are now used to living in and interacting with a different culture. You may even find that readjusting to life in the US is more difficult than the initial adaption to your host country! Instead of ignoring this reverse culture shock, learn about it and about effective ways to combat it. Rest assured, there are many resources that may be helpful as you make the adjustment to being back at home. You can find some resources on GEO's website (under [[Reverse Culture Shock|http://vanderbi.lt/reversecultureshock]]); you might want to bookmark it for when you come back! We're also listing some right here.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources for Reverse Culture Shock|\u000a|[[Top 10 Challenges Faced on Returning from Study Abroad|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/challenges_returnees.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Adjusting to Life Back Home|http://www.studyabroad.illinois.edu/resources/return/adjusting_home.aspx]]|\u000a|[[Common Challenges and Coping Strategies|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/returneechallenges.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Tips for Family and Friends on Welcoming a Student Home|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/twelvetips_parents.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Small Planet Studio, an online community for study abroad alums|http://www.smallplanetstudio.com/]]|\u000a|[[Melibee Global|http://www.melibeeglobal.com/]]|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Opportunities for returned students">>\u005c

V!GEO's Annual Photo Contest\u000a!!!!Keep the contest in mind as you decide what to photograph!\u000aEvery year, GEO conducts a photo contest. We solicit photos from students who went abroad in the 12 months previous and choose the best images to feature.\u000a\u000aWe will contact you via email, usually in the summer, to request your entries in the contest. \u000aThere are prizes, but we also invite the entire Vanderbilt campus and alumni community to take part in the judging process. If you're a winner, your photo will be seen by tens of thousands of people! We put the winning photos on live exhibit in the Student Life Center, and they tend to show up in campus publications as well, including //Vanderbilt Magazine.//\u000a\u000aPhotos can be of any subject (scenery, activities, cultures, etc.) but please be tasteful and respectful as you snap your pics.\u000a\u000aIf you just want to share photos of your experiences without entering the contest, we have an outlet for that, too!\u000a\u000aGEO is particularly keen on photos that show Vanderbilt students participating in academic and cultural endeavors. Scenery is beautiful, but action shots with Vandy representatives (such as yourself) tell interesting stories!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Quick guidelines for ethical photography|Ethical photography]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "What to do next">>\u005c

V!Preparation and responsibilities\u000a!!!!Get ready to go abroad, and to take advantage of opportunities when you return\u000aThere are many things that you need to do to prepare to go abroad. GEO can't help you manage all of them, of course, but we have prepared a checklist of things to do not only before you leave, but also while you're abroad and after you return to the US. (Later in this presentation, we'll also discuss tips for packing, traveling with prescription drugs, and other topics.)\u000a\u000aIn addition to responsibilities, the checklist also highlights opportunities you can prepare for or take advantage of.\u000a\u000a<<if $summer and (not $maymester)>>[[Summer Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=12585]]\u000a<<elseif $maymester>>[[Maymester Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=12584]]\u000a<<else>>[[Semester Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=11244]]\u000a<</if>>\u000a<<segue "Conduct and law">>\u005c

V!Making friends\u000a!!!!Consider your goals as well as your opportunities\u000aStarting off in a foreign country is in some ways like being a first-year student again. //Everything// is new, including all of the other students. Most study abroad programs offer orientation activities at the beginning of the semester. Take advantage of social opportunities during this orientation. It's your best chance to get to know the other participants, and it's not hard--luckily, they happen to be in the market for new friends too!\u000a\u000aWhile it will be great to have friends in your program, you should be aware of the disadvantages of spending too much time with other Americans. If your goals include meeting local people, learning the language, or becoming something more than a long-stay tourist, you will need to look beyond the American crowd.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Making local friends">>\u005c

V!Making __local__ friends\u000a!!!!Get involved--outside your comfort zone!\u000aGEO strongly encourages our students to get to know local people and students in more than superficial ways. Not only does this provide the greatest opportunities for building cross-cultural and language skills, it will also give you a more meaningful experience. But getting to know locals can seem daunting. Here are some tips!\u000a\u000aIn most countries, your visa or residence permit will allow you to ''volunteer'' in the community or even do an ''internship'' or other paid work: fantastic ways to immerse yourself in the local community while also beefing up your resume! If you have questions about whether you can volunteer in your country, [[contact GEO|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2936BD-9D45-883A-02A56AC77951A353&Link_ID=1B34B64E-9B4D-6FCE-D278333739D84B5D&pID=1&lID=5]].\u000a\u000aIf you will be living with a ''host family'', explore the opportunities provided by their wider social network. They likely know people that you might like to get to know!\u000a\u000aIf you are enrolled in or taking classes at a university, join ''student organizations'' on campus. Your campus probably has many clubs and intramural sports, and joining up is a great way to find locals who share your interests.\u000a\u000aVisit your university's ''office of international student services''. In addition to local knowledge about bus routes and student discounts, they may offer inexpensive excursions and other social opportunities.\u000a\u000aMost important, ''put yourself out there!'' It may be uncomfortable at first, but it will pay off in the long run!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Homestays">>\u000a   [[Gifts and relationships|Gifts and relationships]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u000a

V<<sidebar "Gifts and Relationships">>\u000aPresenting a gift shows that you place importance on a relationship. Consider a gift to start off your more important relationships abroad, such as with your homestay family or a host-country roommate.\u000a\u000aIn a cross-cultural setting, the best gifts can be those that let you bring a little of where you're from to the relationship. Examples might include a Vanderbilt mug or pendant, a photo book about Nashville or your hometown, maple syrup if you're from Vermont, or maybe biscuit or grits mix if you're from the South. Not only are gifts like these polite, positive, well-meaning gestures, they can also spur conversations ("Is a biscuit the same thing as a scone?")\u000a\u000aPhotos of home are another great conversation starter. Make sure you have along some photos of your family, your house, your campus, your hobbies, etc. It's a great way for people to feel like they are getting to know you and where you come from. \u000a\u000a<<segue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Academic systems abroad">>\u000aHigher education and academic systems abroad can vary greatly from what you are used to in the United States. Here are some things that might be different depending on the country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Differences in academic systems abroad|\u000a|There are fewer hours spent in the classroom, and students are expected to spend more time studying on their own. This doesn't mean that there will be assigned homework! A lot of responsibility for deciding how best to spend your homework hours may be left up to you.|\u000a|Depending on the course and level you are taking, and whether you are taking it in a foreign language, you may need to spend extra time learning and mastering the material.|\u000a|There are fewer tests and quizzes, and students may earn a grade based on just one final exam, or a mid-term and a final. This means you'll have less chance to gauge how a professor grades in the weeks or months before an exam.|\u000a|Professors are less accessible for office hours, and by email.|\u000a|Classes may be more lecture-style than discussion-based. This may leave fewer opportunities to ask questions or express your opinions.|\u000a|There may not be much sense of privacy attached to grades. For example, the instructor might post all exam grades publicly. In some places, individual grades may be discussed openly in class.|\u000a|The prevailing academic culture may well be very different. For example, students may not be as concerned--or concerned at all--about getting high grade point averages.|\u000a|In some places, such as Latin America, students pursue something like a strict professional degree, without a liberal arts component. They may have a much more focused academic experience.|\u000a|Students likely do not live on campus, which may mean that you need to meet people through academics at first, or join a club.|\u000a|<hr>//Every country is different!

V!Identity and diversity\u000a!!!!Research beliefs, attitudes, and experiences\u000aOur surroundings shape us and help to define who we are. Living in another cultural context will give you the chance to explore many facets of your identity, and to consider them in light of new surroundings. Students overwhelmingly tell us that this process leads to increased personal growth and insight. However, it often carries difficulties too.\u000a\u000aAs you gear up for your time abroad, prepare yourself for how people in your new culture will perceive your identity. Just as in the US, people abroad will have beliefs, myths, stereotypes, and prejudices about aspects of personal identity. You may also find that the way(s) in which you identify yourself in the US differ from how others will identify you abroad.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!You might be surprised to learn...|\u000a|The components of identity that most impact the treatment of students abroad are ''nationality'' and ''gender'', no matter what their background.|\u000a\u000aResearch the viewpoints held by people of your host country, including beliefs, laws, and customs that revolve around nationality, race and ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, mobility, and more. You may be able to prevent or at least alleviate cultural misunderstandings by learning as much as you can about your host culture before leaving. But also prepare for how your time abroad might change, challenge, and strengthen your identity. \u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "More Specific Topics">>\u000a   [[Being American abroad|Being American abroad]]\u000a   [[Gender roles abroad|Gender roles abroad]]\u000a   [[Race and ethnicity abroad|Race and ethnicity abroad]]\u000a   [[Sexual and gender identity abroad|Sexual and gender identity abroad]]\u000a   [[Religious identity abroad|Religious identity abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u005c\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Race and ethnicity abroad">>\u000aDepending on who you are and where you are going, you may feel a part of a racial or ethnic majority for the first time in your life. Or you may have the opposite experience, becoming a racial minority in one fell swoop. Either way, you will likely find that your ethnic or racial identity has different implications in your new host country than it has at home. \u000a\u000aThese new vantage points on self and identity can be exciting, but they can also be difficult. People may consistently misidentify you based on physical appearance, for example. Or you may be surprised at how freely people comment on appearance. If your appearance is very exotic for your host culture, you may find that you are stared at, or that people want to touch your hair or skin.\u000a\u000aOr, it's possible that your physical appearance and racial or ethnic identity is almost totally ignored, and all that really seems to matter is your nationality and gender.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling to a location that is part of your own heritage, be aware that people there may not see your heritage as the most important thing about you. If you are from the US, you may find that people there identify you as an American first. You should be prepared to be considered an outsider.   \u000a\u000aFor all of these reasons, it will be wise to prepare yourself in advance for the attitudes on race and ethnicity held by people of your host country. Do some research, and also see whether talking with alums of the program might help.

V<<sidebar "Sexual and gender identity abroad">>\u000aIf you identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, or intersex, you will want to take time to consider whether and how you plan to be out abroad. Depending on where you are traveling, your destination may provide you with either a more open environment than the US, or a much less welcoming one. Either way, be prepared: make yourself aware in advance of local attitudes, beliefs, and understandings. Ask yourself questions like the following:\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions for LGBTQI Students to Consider:|\u000a|What behaviors are legal in my host country? If I am interested in activism, are there ways to practice it both safely and legally?|\u000a|<hr>Is it safe for me to be out in my host country and city?|\u000a|<hr>How open do I want or need to be about my gender or sexual identity while abroad? Do I plan to be out? How specifically will I reconcile my human rights with the cultural values of my host country?|\u000a|<hr>If my destination is one where I need to conceal my identity, how will this impact my experience?|\u000a|<hr>What are the cultural norms surrounding friendship and dating in my host culture?|\u000a|<hr>What norms surround publicly identifying as LGBTQI in my host culture? How does my self-presentation "read" in my host culture's system of gendered norms and expectations?|\u000a|<hr>What is the LGBTQI community in my host city like? How is it different from the community at home?|\u000a|<hr>What on-site resources will I have if I experience any issues/concerns while I am abroad? Are there LGBTQI organizations or other resources at my host university or in my host city?|\u000a|<hr>Do I have concerns about my housing situation? (If living with a host family, consider making the housing coordinator aware that you would like a host family that has hosted LGBQTI students in the past.)|\u000a|<hr>Might I face challenges with travel and documents due to my gender presentation?|\u000a\u000aRegardless of self-identification, all students should be aware not only of local attitudes and beliefs surrounding sex and sexual identity, but also of local laws. Some countries criminalize speech as well as behavior, and you need to be well informed about matters that could affect your safety and well-being. The [[ILGA website|http://ilga.org/]] is a good resource for checking on legal regimes around the world. \u000a\u000aStudy abroad is often a time when students explore identity and selfhood. If you are not out at home and are considering being out abroad, please make doubly sure that you do your research and ensure that your safety and well-being are provided for. If you will live with a homestay family and want to be out to them, consider telling the housing coordinator in advance that you would like an LGBQTI-friendly family. You can stipulate that they keep your request confidential, including from the family.\u000a\u000aThe local LGBQTI community will likely be quite different from that in your home country. Coming to know and understand this new culture will likely be exciting and rewarding, but like any process of cultural adaptation it may also be trying at times. Learn as much as you can in advance, but also adopt the attitude that difficulties are challenges to overcome rather than merely obstacles in your way.\u000a\u000aIt may be helpful to talk with others who have studied or traveled in your host country. You may be able to take advantage of welcoming contexts on campus, such as the [[Office of LGBQTI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], to help you network with past participants. Your study abroad provider may be able to connect you with LGBQTI alumni of your specific program, and can also serve as an excellent resource both before you leave and while you're abroad.\u000a\u000aIf you would like to talk about any aspect of your program with the Global Education Office, please do not hesitate to [[contact us|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2936BD-9D45-883A-02A56AC77951A353&Link_ID=1B34B64E-9B4D-6FCE-D278333739D84B5D&pID=1&lID=5]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|Vanderbilt's [[Office of LGBQTI Life|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtqi/]], a cultural center and resource for information and support about gender and sexuality|\u000a|[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|http://ilga.org/]] provides legal information on every country, as well as news and reports on the state of LGBTQI rights around the world|\u000a|[[International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission|http://iglhrc.org/]] has extensive country-specific resources.|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG bibliography|http://overseas.iu.edu/living/glbt_biblio.shtml]], bibliography of LGBQTI literature with an international perspective|\u000a|[[Rainbow SIG|http://www.rainbowsig.org/]], an organization of study abroad professionals|\u000a|[[ILGA-Europe|http://www.ilga-europe.org/]], the website of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's European chapter, provides multiple resources, including a Guide to Europe|\u000a|[[Utopia|http://www.utopia-asia.com/]], an online guide to Asia-Pacific gay and lesbian resources, including legal and cultural information as well as links to country-specific resources|\u000a|[[Travel at Transgender Equality|http://transequality.org/Issues/travel.html]]: air travel tips for transgender people|\u000a|[[US passport requirements|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/gender.html]] for transgender students|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c\u000a

V<<sidebar "Gender roles abroad">>\u000aExpectations surrounding gender roles vary from country to country, and even within countries. Because so much of our communication with others is interpreted in terms of gender, it is helpful to learn something about gender roles in your host culture. One of the best things about study abroad is making new friends, and you will want to avoid undue friction due to misunderstanding and miscommunication.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Things to think about include:|\u000a|Americans are accustomed to having non-romantic friendships with the opposite sex. How does your host culture view opposite-sex friendships?|\u000a|<hr>If you are considering being sexually active abroad, research safe sex and birth control practices as well as attitudes toward sex outside marriage.|\u000a|<hr>What constitutes sexual harassment under local law or understanding?|\u000a|<hr>How do locals dress on the street? What might your manner of dress communicate to them about you?|\u000a\u000aWhile men studying abroad will certainly see cultural differences in their roles, it is women who will need to adapt most to local norms and values. North American women should be aware that they may face special sets of attitudes and assumptions.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Women may want to further research questions like these:|\u000a|In some countries (particularly Latin countries), catcalls or other forms of harassment of women might be common. Is this sort of think likely in your country? How will you deal with it if so?|\u000a|<hr>What behaviors might be construed as sexual? Smiling or greeting strangers? Looking directly at others? Going out at night without a companion of the opposite sex?|\u000a\u000aIt can be useful to talk with [[study abroad alumni|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewDocument&File_ID=9604]] of your host country about what they've experienced.

V<<sidebar "Religious identity abroad">>\u000aReligion is a prominent feature of cultures around the world, even in countries that are officially atheist. During your time abroad, you will likely encounter fascinating and enriching ideas and practices. You may also experience things that challenge your notions of spiritual truth or even basic fairness. \u000a\u000aIf you plan to practice your own religion abroad, do some research first. You'll want to know whether there are convenient houses of worship, of course. But depending on where you are going, there may be safety issues to consider as well.\u000a\u000aIn some countries, there may be little commitment to religious pluralism. The state may sanction a religion. Or laws may restrict religious speech, particularly as it relates to political activism. In China, for example, it is illegal to use religion to "disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state."\u000a\u000aEven if the society is generally an open one, be aware that safety concerns may still exist. Just as in the US, wearing symbols of some religions, or even frequenting houses of worship, may make you a target for passionate violence from other groups. \u000a\u000aWhatever your personal beliefs and circumstances, remember that your primary purpose is studying abroad. Consider your experiences an opportunity to understand the historical and social dimensions of religion in your host country. Be open-minded, save critical impulses for later, and open your own beliefs and practices to the same degree of scrutiny. If you approach your time in your host country as a time to learn about others' beliefs and attitudes, you can avoid many opportunities for conflict.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself|\u000a|Is there a dominant religion in my host country?|\u000a|<hr>What laws exist pertaining to religion?

V<<sidebar "Being American abroad">>\u000aIf you grew up in the US and identify as American, your American-ness will probably be the most important factor in how natives of your host country relate to you. (This is true no matter what your background.) While other components of your identity may well be important factors, the fact that you are American will be a critical component of your identity abroad.\u000a\u000aBe prepared to encounter curiosity and interest. America's unique economic, political, and cultural position in the world mean that people all around the world take an interest. You may be asked all sorts of questions, from what it's like to live in America to what you think of politics and other issues in the US. (The FBI has recently warned that American students abroad may also be the target of espionage recruitment.)\u000a\u000aMost interest you receive will probably be friendly, even if frankly or passionately expressed! But do prepare yourself to encounter actual hostility as well, and to consider how you might handle it.\u000a\u000aIn many places, people may assume that because you are American, you are also rich. Or they may have other assumptions, based on media portrayals, local history with US policies or intervention, or other sources. Do some research before you go so that you can have some idea of what being an American might mean in your host country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Quick tip|\u000a|In some parts of the world, you should be careful about referring to yourself as "American." The entire Western Hemisphere is properly called America, and in Central and South America people may find the term "American" arrogant when used for just one country. Plan on referring to yourself as North American (//norteamericano//) instead.|\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Diversity Issues in Study Abroad|http://www.smith.edu/studyabroad/docs/diversity_st_abroad01.pdf]]: A booklet that collects statements of Brown University students about their experiences of identity abroad.

V<<sidebar "More on credit cards">>\u000aEurope and much of the rest of the world are moving to chip-and-PIN (or EMV) "smart" credit cards. These cards offer more secure transactions by adding an embedded microchip and replacing easily forged signatures with the entry of a PIN number.\u000a\u000aStudents should be able to function abroad with a regular US swipe card, which are still accepted by most businesses. However, US swipe cards are not likely to work at most self-serve kiosks.\u000a\u000aDepending on your bank, it may be possible for you to get a chip-and-PIN card in the US for use overseas. If you decide to explore this route, be aware that there is a difference between chip-and-PIN and chip-and-signature cards. Chip-and-signature cards will not work in automated kiosks abroad, for example.\u000a\u000aRegardless of whether you choose a chip-embedded card, you may want to shop around for banks and credit card companies before you leave. Seek out cards that carry low foreign transaction fees, as well as debit card providers with overseas partnerships that allow for lower ATM fees.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Where will you live?">>

V<<sidebar "Disclosing medical information">>\u000aGEO strongly recommends that you disclose all medical conditions to your program staff. Even if you are diligent in the management of your health, studying abroad can present challenges you may not have foreseen. You or your body may react in unexpected ways. It is in your best interest to give your on-site staff the tools necessary to ensure you have a safe and successful time abroad. \u000a\u000aAny health-related history you provide is used to support your stay. It would only be shared in the case of a medical or mental health emergency--and only with the appropriate clinicians or staff on site. \u000a\u000aYou might even consider signing a Release of Information (ROI) form with your physician. This document would grant your doctor permission to share your medical history with the person(s) named in the ROI. This would enable you to be cared for in the event that you were incapacitated and unable to grant the permission yourself.\u000a\u000a<<segue "Medical insurance">>\u005c\u000a

V<<sidebar "Coping with stress & culture shock">>\u000aCulture shock is one expression of stress, but even after culture shock passes, living and studying abroad may sometimes be stressful. Stress may be harder to manage when you are far from your normal support group of family and friends. Learn to recognize the signs of stress and take steps to cope with the situation and make yourself more resilient.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|>|>|Common signs of stress|h\u000a|exhaustion|fatigue|change in appetite|\u000a|anxiety|isolation|alienation|\u000a|frustration|extreme homesickness|increased use of nicotine, alcohol or drugs|\u000a|loneliness|change in behavior|self-harming|\u000a|>|>|new or more frequent physical symptoms, e.g. headaches, stomachaches, etc.|\u000a\u000aOne of the best ways to combat stress in a new environment is to prepare for the new location. ''Learn as much as you can about your host city'' before you go. Read up on climate, foods, politics, culture, religion, and more. Buy a phrasebook and try to learn some of the basics of the language.\u000a\u000a''Take a step back.'' Analyze your situation and study your own reactions. Where exactly is the stress coming from? Ask yourself if cultural differences might be a contributing factor, and how you can work with or around them. Focus on what you can change or control, not on what you can't: If you can't change the situation, work on changing your reactions to it.\u000a\u000a''Take care of your body.'' Be sure that you are staying active, eating well, and getting enough sleep. Work on being positive, and be active--get out of your room.\u000a\u000a''Identify what helps you //healthfully// manage stress.'' Avoid using pills, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, over- or under-eating, and oversleeping to manage stress. Instead, focus on healthy antidotes and find the ones that work for you. Ideas include exercise, keeping a journal, regular social contact with //positive// people, hobbies, other leisure activities, or cultural activities.\u000a\u000a''Find your social support.'' Identify your support groups both locally and at home. These might include program staff, housing staff, homestay family, friends, home university staff, or family.

V!Eating and diet\u000a!!!!Balancing dietary requirements with cultural exploration\u000aPeople everywhere eat differently because they are different--they have different cultures. Exploring another culture means exploring its food. GEO recommends that you keep an open mind, accept cultural differences, and try everything you (safely!) can. Have a gastronomic adventure!\u000a\u000aIf you have dietary restrictions, eating well while fully experiencing your host culture may be a challenge. Whether you maintain your diet for medical, religious, philosophical, or other reasons, be sure to share the details with your program staff //before// you arrive on site. They will use this information to help identify appropriate housing for you. They may also be able to research restaurants, grocery stores, and useful vocabulary.\u000a\u000aIf you have a food allergy, be very detailed in what is safe for you.  For example, if you have a nut allergy, can you be around nuts? can you eat food processed on the same equipment as nuts? are all nuts harmful for you? Let your program and host family know.\u000a\u000aLearn as much as you can about your host culture's food, food culture, and food vocabulary before you go. Your diet and the terms you use for it may not be well understood there, so be prepared to explain why you can\u2019t, or choose not to, eat certain foods--ideally before someone cooks you a meal! \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Food|http://www.ciee.org/gap-year-abroad/downloads/school-resources/Food.pdf]], a pamphlet on "the edible part of culture"|\u000a|[[International Vegetarian Union|http://www.worldvegfest.org/]], information and recipes for vegetarians and vegans worldwide|\u000a|[[VegGuide|http://www.vegguide.org/]], a searchable guide to vegetarian restaurants worldwide|\u000a|[[SelectWisely|http://www.selectwisely.com/Resources/]], a library of links to information about traveling abroad with dietary restrictions|\u000a|[[Jewish Travel Advisor|http://jewishtraveladvisor.com/]], world-wide listing of kosher hotels and restaurants, synagogues, mikvaot, and Jewish communities around the world |\u000a|[[Halal Trip|http://www.halaltrip.com/city-guide-all]], website focused on Muslim travelers and including city guides with a focus on halal dining|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Making friends">>\u005c

V!Preparing for safety\u000a!!!!Research your destination and register your travel\u000aWhile not generally more dangerous than life in Nashville, study abroad is not a risk-free activity. You are traveling into an unfamiliar country and situation, and the the most effective way to avoid problems is to plug the gaps in your knowledge.\u000a\u000aThe more you know and learn about your destination before you go, the safer you will be. Read all the program information you are given, and do your own research as well. Up-to-date commercial guidebooks are often good resources, particularly for coverage of local risks and high-crime areas. Country-specific information provided by the US Department of State and its counterparts overseas can also be helpful.\u000a\u000aKnow the local laws, and learn about behavioral norms and expectations. Outspokenness and ostentatious public behavior are not virtues in most places abroad. In some situations they may invite unwanted attention and problems.

V!Basic safety abroad\u000a!!!!Tips for staying safe while out and about\u000aYou are the best guarantor of your own safety! While abroad, commit yourself to being an alert and observant traveler at all times. Anticipate problems by learning to read the local environment, and by knowing where and when to be hypervigilant. If you aren't paying attention, you can easily become the victim of opportunistic crime.\u000a\u000a''Know where you are going and look like you belong''. Definitely bring your map along, but don't check it in the open street, where looking lost could get you robbed. Be friendly, but don't hesitate to refuse offers of help from strangers, especially near ATMs, ticket machines, train and metro stations, and baggage lines.\u000a\u000a''Avoid demonstrations and political disturbances'' of all kinds. Crowd behavior is unpredictable, and even peaceful marches can turn violent.\u000a\u000a''Get a working cell phone'' and carry it with you. Some programs require students to have a phone, and most will provide you information on getting a cheap phone that works locally. A phone can be a literal lifeline in an emergency--carry one!\u000a\u000aSecure your travel and identification documents at all times, and store duplicate copies in multiple places. ''Know your local emergency numbers'', particularly for your resident director or program staff and for the local equivalent of 911. \u000a\u000aLearn local traffic patterns and traffic laws, as well as safe pedestrian habits. Road safety issues and driving accidents are the //primary// cause of injury to students abroad. Given the risks of traffic accidents, ''Vanderbilt does //not// recommend the rental of motor vehicles while studying abroad''.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Road safety overseas|Road safety overseas]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<segue "Personal emergencies">>\u005c

V!Personal emergencies\u000a!!!!What to do after experiencing a personal emergency\u000aPersonal emergencies may arise from illness, accidents, behavioral health crises, or criminal/negligent behavior. They generally require immediate assistance, whether from a health professional, law enforcement, a counselor, or some combination of these. If you encounter a personal emergency abroad, follow these steps:\u000a\u000a''Request help immediately''. Know the local [[emergency number or numbers|http://studentsabroad.state.gov/content/pdfs/911_ABROAD.pdf]] (911 doesn't work abroad!) and have your phone with you at all times.\u000a\u000a''Notify your program's emergency contact''. At least one member of your program's staff will be available to you around the clock. On-site personnel are best positioned to provide timely and appropriate emergency support. If you are reporting an emergency on behalf of a friend, be sure to identify yourself as well as your friend.\u000a\u000aIf you are in immediate danger, or have been in a serious accident or the victim of a criminal act, ''contact law enforcement as soon as possible''. Your program staff may be in a better position to talk with law enforcement, and will also know the proper protocols. Work with him or her if at all possible.\u000a\u000a''Contact your insurance provider'' if the emergency requires medical attention of any kind. Depending on the nature of the emergency, it may also be appropriate to contact International SOS (ISOS). See information later in this presentation.\u000a\u000a''Notify the Vanderbilt Global Education Office''. A direct notification from you will help us coordinate support services. We can often provide additional assistance or help streamline communications.\u000a\u000a''Contact the nearest embassy''. Consular agents at US embassies are available 24/7 to help US citizens with emergencies. If you are not a US citizen, contact both the US embassy and your home country's embassy.\u000a\u000a''Contact your family''. Your family will be anxious and concerned about your well-being. Your program staff and GEO are both limited in the information they can share, so be sure to communicate with your family directly.\u000a\u000aDownload GEO's [[wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|http://studentsabroad.com/handbook/emergency-card.php?country=General]].\u000a\u000a<<segue "Large-scale emergencies">>\u005c

V!Large-scale emergencies\u000a!!!!Procedures for dealing with large-scale disaster\u000aLarge-scale emergencies take many forms. Massive accidents, civil strife, acts of terrorism, natural disasters... They are hard to predict and proper response depends heavily on local circumstances. \u000a\u000aIn general, your program staff will brief you soon after arrival on emergency protocols. Local emergency plans typically include the following elements:\u000a\u000a*a pre-established location where students and staff will assemble after a large-scale disaster;\u000a*communications protocols designed to account for all program participants;\u000a*an evacuation plan;\u000a*contingency plans short of full evacuation.\u000a\u000aThe most important general advice that Vanderbilt can offer is that you know the protocols of your site's emergency plan. Keep calm, follow those protocols, and act with common sense and your best knowledge of the local situation.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling independently or are unable to reach your rally point, contact International SOS (ISOS). Vanderbilt contracts with ISOS to provide emergency services around the globe. They can provide you with information as well as direct aid. See the information on the next page.\u000a\u000aDownload GEO's [[wallet-sized emergency numbers directory|http://studentsabroad.com/handbook/emergency-card.php?country=General]].\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[FAQ on the US Department of State's role in crises overseas|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/crisis-support.html]]|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's ISOS portal|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BSGM000066]], includes contact information|\u000a\u000a<<segue "International SOS">>\u005c

V!International SOS\u000a!!!!Emergency and travel assistance for Vanderbilt students\u000aVanderbilt contracts with International SOS (ISOS) primarily to handle responses to major emergencies overseas. ISOS also offers other services, and as a Vanderbilt student, you have access to all of them. But you should be aware that not all are free to you.\u000a\u000aThe primary role of ISOS is to aid in response to large-scale disasters and crises. For example, during the "Arab Spring," ISOS evacuated a Vanderbilt student from Egypt. The organization runs a worldwide network of centers, clinics, and ambulances to deal with ill or wounded people. If you use ISOS in such an emergency, Vanderbilt will cover the cost.\u000a\u000aISOS can also help you with medical, personal, security, legal, or travel problems. Examples might include dealing with a lost passport, a critical missed airline connection, medical help, or other issues. ISOS provides these services on a fee-for-service basis (it is //not// a health insurer). While Vanderbilt may cover the up-front charges in non-emergency circumstances, ''you may be billed for these services after the fact!'' \u000a\u000aISOS also offers excellent safety information both on its [[website|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BSGM000066]] and via emailed updates, which you must register your travel in order to receive.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's ISOS portal|https://www.internationalsos.com/MasterPortal/default.aspx?membnum=11BSGM000066]], up-to-date risk ratings and travel security advisories.

V<<sidebar "Road safety overseas">>\u000aMovies and media reporting have conditioned us to think that the greatest threats to safety abroad are dramatic, "foreign," and of the "third world." The reality is that the ''number one cause of injury and death for American students abroad is traffic accidents''. And the vast majority of these occur in wealthy, industrialized countries.\u000a\u000aGEO suggests that you train yourself to pay maximum attention at all times. Avoid earbuds as well as drinking--both can impair perception! Know the basic patterns of traffic, and remember to pay attention to the right side of the road in countries where traffic flow is reversed!\u000a\u000aAvoid traveling late at night, and always choose the safest form of transportation available. If you have a choice between riding in a taxicab or on the roof of a crowded bus--choose the cab! If walking is your safest option, do that whenever possible.\u000a\u000aJust as in the US, if you are a passenger, you should always wear a seatbelt. Avoid riding with anyone who appears intoxicated, over-tired, or emotionally distraught. Always sit in the back seat of a taxi.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries present other risks, including shady taxi drivers, unsafe vehicles, overcrowded transport, etc. Your program staff will provide you with information about your options and help you assess risk. Don't be afraid to ask questions! \u000a\u000aVanderbilt strongly advises against renting a vehicle while abroad. Cars, SUVs, motorcycles, and mopeds are equally poor choices. The risks of driving when the rules of the road are unfamiliar are just too great.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Road Safety Overseas|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/go/safety/road.html]], US Department of State|\u000a|[[Country-specific information from US Department of State|http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html]], includes information on road safety for every country in the world|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Personal emergencies">>\u005c

Intoxication is a factor is the major factor in injuries and deaths experienced by American students abroad. Physical and mental impairment also make it difficult for you to take precautions for your own safety--including your sexual well-being.\u000a\u000aIf you do drink, do so in moderation. Be careful what you consume, and always watch your drink to avoid having it spiked with a dangerous substance. \u000a\u000aRemember that your behavior is subject to local laws, to policies set by your program provider and/or university, //and// to [[Vanderbilt policy|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcohol/]].

Public intoxication is always inappropriate, may be illegal, and can lead to serious--even fatal--consequences.\u000a\u000aIf you are uncertain about specific policies or laws abroad, please consult with a local program representative.

V<<sidebar "Your legal status in your host country">>\u000aMany US citizens are under the impression that their US passport acts as a "get out of jail free" card overseas. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever your nationality, if you are arrested, you will be subject to the entire foreign legal process--including imprisonment. Neither Vanderbilt or your government can do anything to get you out of prison!\u000a\u000aKnow the laws of your host country! Be aware that conditions in foreign jails and prisons may be very different from those in your home country. The legal system will also be difficult to understand and navigate. Your home country's consular officials can provide a wide array of services, but they //cannot extricate you from the situation//.\u000a\u000aDrug arrests can be particularly bad in many places. Harsh sentences, no bail, and dire conditions characterize many countries. Know the local laws and think twice before making a jail stay part of your time abroad.

V<<sidebar "Sexual misconduct abroad">>\u000aNorms of behavior, including sexual behavior, vary across the world. Depending on where you study abroad, you may find attitudes in your host country either more or less enlightened than those in the United States. Laws related to sex and sexual behavior will vary too, since laws tend to reflect the prevailing attitudes and norms of the societies that make them.\u000a\u000aWhile laws and social norms may be different in your host country, your study abroad program will probably //not// follow suit. Your program almost certainly caters to North American students, and if so ''expectations for behavior on your program will be very similar to those at Vanderbilt.''  Just as at Vanderbilt, these expectations apply to both students and to staff and faculty hired by the program.\u000a\u000aIf you are a victim of sexual misconduct while abroad, you should contact the resident director of your program for help. If your program is directly administered by Vanderbilt faculty, you should consult with your program leader. If it is not possible or advisable for you to discuss the issue with program staff, please contact Vanderbilt's [[Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/]] (EAD). \u000a\u000aIf you are found to have perpetrated an act or acts of sexual misconduct while on your abroad program, you may face disciplinary sanctions back at Vanderbilt. This is true for any breach of the Vanderbilt code of conduct.\u000a\u000aIf you have questions or are not sure where to turn, please contact the [[Global Education Office|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2BA4C0-FC49-E73B-80E95C6B35878D81&Link_ID=1B4BC93A-F781-026B-FAC336662CD56FF3&pID=11&lID=65]] for confidential assistance.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[VU Student Handbook on Sexual Misconduct|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/sexual-misconduct/]], includes comprehensive definition of sexual misconduct|\u000a|[[VU Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ead/]]|\u000a|[[Vanderbilt's anti-harassment policy|http://hr.vanderbilt.edu/policies/anti-harassment.php]], covering sexual and other types of harassment|\u000a\u000a<<segue "Grades and credits">>\u005c
