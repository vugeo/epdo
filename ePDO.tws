V<<sidebar "Vanderbilt policy on alcohol abroad">>\u000aVanderbilt does not really treat alcohol use abroad any differently than it does on campus. However, in all of the countries where Vanderbilt has approved study abroad programs, the drinking age is lower than it is here in Nashville. You need to abide by the legal drinking age of the country you're in. Remember that violations of law overseas may also become grounds for disciplinary action both at Vanderbilt and under the rules of your abroad program.\u000a\u000aAt the same time that you are considering the legal implications of drinking, be mindful of cultural norms surrounding alcohol use in your host country. In many countries, for example, American-style "binge drinking" may appear pathological or merely pathetic. Take the opportunity to see cultural practices in a new light. \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!The Student Handbook says:|\u000a|Students are required to abide by the laws of the respective countries in which they reside, study, or travel, with respect to the age at which alcoholic beverages may be consumed. Otherwise, the policies with respect to [[alcoholic beverages and controlled substances|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/alcohol/]] included in the Vanderbilt //Student Handbook// apply. Students are subject to student-accountability sanctions, including expulsion, and referral for prosecution for violation of these policies.|\u000a|<hr>//From// [[VU Student Handbook, Study Abroad|http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/university-policies-regulations/#study-abroad]]|\u000a\u000a<<continue "Grades and credits">>\u005c

V!Student status and billing\u000a!!!!You remain a Vanderbilt student while abroad!\u000aWhile studying abroad, you ''remain registered as a Vanderbilt student'' and you retain access to on-campus resources. You can register for classes, log in to YES and other campus applications, and make use of services (including [[counseling|https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/pcc/]]).\u000a<<if $facultyled neq "true">> \u000aTo make this possible, GEO enrolls you in a study abroad &ldquo;''placeholder course''.&rdquo; The placeholder will appear on your YES account before you go abroad. The actual courses you take abroad, as well as the grades you earned, will eventually replace the placeholder. This will occur only after your transcript arrives from abroad and both GEO and the University Registrar have processed it. ''It may take 2 to 6 months'' from the end of your program for your transcript to arrive, depending on individual circumstances.<</if>>\u000a\u000a''Billing'' works just as it does for on-campus students. Vanderbilt Student Accounts will bill you, and your bill will arrive at the same time as usual, with the same payment terms. You can find the fees for your program in GEO's [[Cost Calculator|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=B6A18B3E-FF30-D2BF-DB945C58C1748491&Link_ID=A02DB6D2-A969-AD00-E852344EC0D31EA1&pID=5&lID=33]].

V!Conduct and law\u000a!!!!Be a good ambassador\u000aWhile you are abroad, be an ambassador for both Vanderbilt and your home country. You are part of a worldwide web of interactions, and the impression you make on the people of your host country reflects on where you came from!\u000a\u000aTake some time to learn about norms in the country you're visiting so that you can attempt to blend in socially. Beyond that, treat those you meet courteously and with sensitivity toward cultural differences. Remember, you are in their world!\u000a\u000aMoreover, you are ''subject to local laws'' while you are abroad. Foreign laws and legal systems may be quite different from those in your home country, and you need to know the differences. If you break local laws while abroad, neither Vanderbilt nor the U.S. Embassy can get you out of jail.\u000a<<if ($vanderbilt neq "true") or ($facultyled neq "true")>>\u000aWhether you are studying abroad at a university or on a smaller program with one of GEO's partners, you must also ''follow that institution's rules and policies''. These institutions may sanction or dismiss you if you violate their rules. //Dismissal from an abroad program will have the same consequences for your GPA and four-year plan as a dismissal from Vanderbilt!//<</if>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "Vanderbilt conduct policies">>\u005c

V!Course equivalency evaluations\u000a!!!!Making sure your courses count for Vanderbilt credit\u000aEvery course you take abroad needs to be evaluated by Vanderbilt faculty to earn Vanderbilt credit. This process determines how the course will count at Vanderbilt--or if it will count at all.\u000a\u000aThe single most important thing to remember about course equivalency evaluations is that ''you are responsible''! GEO facilitates the process, but it falls on you to ensure that your courses get evaluated for credit.

V!Grades and Credits\u000a!!!!You're earning Vanderbilt credit abroad\u000aCourses you take on programs offered through GEO earn you ''direct Vanderbilt credit''. This means that your grades will appear on your Vanderbilt transcript and will factor into your GPA, almost exactly as if you had taken them at VU.\u000a\u000aJust as at Vanderbilt, you must take the equivalent of 12-18 hours of credit. Courses taken on GEO programs can count toward majors and minors, or as hours toward graduation. However, they //do not// count toward AXLE requirements.\u000a\u000aStudy abroad courses come with some special rules:\u000a#You cannot take courses pass/fail. \u000a#You cannot retake classes abroad that you have already taken on campus (and vice versa). If you do take a course abroad that is equivalent to a course you've already taken on campus, you may well get //no credit// for it!\u000a#You cannot opt out of a course you took abroad. Withdraw from courses you don't want to take during the drop/add period!\u000a#Vanderbilt cannot change the grade you earned abroad. If a grade is incorrect, work with your program provider abroad to get it changed and to issue a new transcript.\u000a#You must monitor prerequisites and other requirements for courses you take abroad. Consult with your VU academic advisor, but understand that ultimately you are responsible for taking appropriate courses abroad!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Academics Abroad">>\u000a   [[How might academic systems abroad differ from Vanderbilt?|Academic systems abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "Course equivalency evaluations">>\u005c

Without it, ''you will not be able to cross international borders'', and other tasks--such as transferring funds--may also be made difficult or impossible. Losing your passport can be a major headache, and might even cost you thousands of dollars in airfare for missed flights. Do everything you can to keep it safe!\u000a\u000aIn general, you should only keep your passport on your person when you are traveling across borders. Otherwise, ''find a safe place for it and leave it there.'' Make a photocopy and carry that on you when you are out and about.\u000a<img src="images/passport wallet.jpg" class="right" style="height: 250px;" />\u005c\u000a\u000aIf you must carry your passport with you, keep it in a special ''passport wallet'' under your clothes.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!(Potentially) Good Places to Keep Your Passport|\u000a|Hidden in the room of your homestay or residence hall|\u000a|In your hotel's safe (//not// the room safe)|\u000a|With your study abroad provider, if they offer such a service|\u000a|<hr>//In some situations, even these options may not be secure.

V<<sidebar "How to Get a Travel Visa">>\u000aA ''travel visa'' is not a credit card! It's a stamp or sticker placed in your passport that allows you to visit a foreign country. Depending on your own nationality and your reasons for traveling, ''you may or may not need a visa'' to enter a given country.\u000a\u000aIf you will be taking classes from an institution based in your host country, you will usually need a student-class visa to enter. Entry requirements are often lower when you are simply visiting as a tourist. \u000a\u000aRequirements to get a visa may include photographs, financial information, a letter from your host university, a criminal background check, or even a personal appearance at the foreign consulate. Your own nationality may have a major impact on the requirements you face in getting a visa. For example, US citizens typically face lower barriers than students of other nationalities. \u000a\u000aIn certain cases, students may be able to enter a country without a visa, but will need to obtain a ''residence permit'' after entering.\u000a\u000aYour study abroad provider will inform you about your visa requirements.

V!Traveling while abroad\u000a!!!!Important things to keep in mind when planning travel\u000aFirst, always ''keep your Resident Director or staff informed'' of your travel. Also keep your family in the loop; if there is an emergency back home, they will want to know how get in touch with you!\u000a\u000aSome countries that you plan to visit may have different entry requirements than your primary host country. ''Investigate all the countries you're interested in'' before you leave the US. If any require a visa, it will probably be easier to get the visa while you're in the US (this applies to both international students and US citizens)!\u000a\u000aIn every country you visit, make a point of knowing where your ''home country's nearest embassy or consulate'' is. You want to know where you can find support if you get into real trouble. (If you're a US citizen, you should bookmark the [[list of US embassies around the world|http://www.usembassy.gov/]].)\u000a\u000aFinally, independent travel is one of the ''most expensive activities'' you can undertake abroad. Be sure to budget appropriately, and remember to consider safety while you're on the lookout for ways to travel on the cheap!\u000a<div class="talkbox">\u005c\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Wisdom from alums|\u000a|Every year, students tell us that while they loved the traveling they did abroad, they also regretted not getting to know their host city better. Consider the value of staying put sometimes rather than striking out.|\u000a</div>\u000a<<continue "Passport Check">>\u005c

V!Communicating with home\u000a!!!!Striking a balance\u000aYou will need to strike an appropriate balance between the folks back home and your new life abroad. Your family wants to know you are safe and having a good time, and your friends want to keep in touch--so don\u2019t cut them off completely!\u000a\u000aAt the same time, be careful not to spend //all// your time chatting back home. Constant contact might be tempting, but will ultimately make culture shock harder to bear and prevent you from experiencing your host country to the fullest. Our suggestion for keeping a healthy balance: get out and explore, make new friends, and set up a weekly schedule for contacting home.\u000a\u000aAlso keep your experiences in perspective when you call home. What you report from abroad can seem much more serious to family who aren't around to assess the situation for themselves. Beware of venting; you don\u2019t want to alarm anyone if you are only battling a head cold! Work with your on-site staff to remedy problems, and make sure your family knows you are safe and happy.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Phones and internet abroad|Phones and internet abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "Special accommodations">>

V!Money\u000a!!!!Use debit and credit cards wisely to save money\u000aThe amount of money you spend while studying abroad will vary depending on the local cost of living, your personal spending habits, independent travel, and so on. //How// you access your money can also play a role in maintaining your budget.\u000a\u000aMany businesses will not accept plastic, especially for smaller purchases, so it's a good idea to have ''cash'' on hand throughout your time abroad. The most cost-effective way to get cash abroad is to use your ''debit card'' (not a credit card!) in an ATM. You can usually find out where the ATMs you might need are before you leave the US--ask your bank how!\u000a\u000aGEO also recommends that you bring a ''credit card''. Be aware that every credit card purchase or debit card withdrawal will likely carry transaction fees. Shop around a bit for the best rates before you leave the US, but also minimize the number of times you use your cards. Take out as much cash as you feel comfortable with each time you use the ATM, and use your credit card only when necessary or when you have an especially large purchase.\u000a\u000aBefore you depart the US, and every time you enter a new country, you should inform your bank(s) of your location. If you don't, you may find your cards canceled as an anti-fraud measure! \u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Summary|\u000a|Before you leave, consider seeking out the US banks with the best currency conversion and transaction fees for your host country.|\u000a|Call your bank(s) to let them know you'll be abroad, and whenever you cross international borders.|\u000a|Use your debit card in an ATM to get cash on a weekly or biweekly basis.|\u000a|Use your credit card for purchases.

V!Contacts and communications\u000a!!!!Who should I contact for help abroad?\u000aCommunications abroad can seem difficult at first! You need to learn who are your best resources, as well as figure out the most convenient methods of communication within your host country and back home.\u000a\u000aYour ''Resident Director'' will be your most reliable contact person: he or she is knowledgeable about the program, the host country, and the city--and he/she is //right there!// Whether you have a basic question, a scheduling conundrum, or you are in the midst of an emergency, your Resident Director and on-site staff should be the ''first people you contact.'' You will find out more about who your contact(s) should be in your program-specific predeparture orientation.\u000a\u000a''Remember this:'' Problems will be resolved faster if you work with someone who is on the ground with you, rather than contacting someone back home who is a few time zones and thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Hm...">>\u000a   [[When should I contact GEO?|When should I contact GEO]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "Balancing Contact">>

V!Where will you live?\u000a!!!!What choices do you have in your housing abroad?\u000aSome programs offer you the opportunity to select from multiple housing options. <<if $facultyled eq false>>Which should you choose? (If you're not sure about your housing options, talk to the GEO advisor for your program.)\u000a\u000aThe answer, of course, depends on what you are hoping to get out of your time overseas. \u000a\u000aBut since you may be facing a choice soon, we want to share with you what alumni of Vanderbilt study abroad tell us in their program evaluations: Students who live with natives of their host country typically report greater satisfaction with their housing and integration into the local culture than students who live with Americans. This is true whether students lived with a homestay family or with native roommates of their own age.\u000a<<display "Housing chart">>\u005c\u000a<<else>>You will receive more information from your instructor about housing abroad. If your program has a component in Nashville, you may want to ask your instructor about housing here on campus.\u000a<</if>>\u000aPlease note that [[Vanderbilt University policy|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2BA4C0-FC49-E73B-80E95C6B35878D81&Link_ID=1B4B6ADC-B154-3B65-716254775A4B2E6D&pID=11&lID=65#housing]] does not allow you to find your own housing, //unless// your program doesn't offer prearranged housing.\u000a   \u000a<<continue "Making friends">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Going Abroad...Again!">>\u000aStudents who return from abroad often feel they need to go abroad again!\u000a\u000aIf you are not graduating and you have room in your academic schedule, you are welcome to ''apply for another GEO study abroad program''--there is no rule that says you can only go once! Or, if you are more strapped for time, consider ''volunteering abroad''! You can go over break either with OACS or on your own. You may even be able to find funding (ask OACS about the Nichols Humanitarian Fund!).\u000a\u000aOr consider ''graduate studies abroad''. Several universities around the world welcome international students for graduate degrees. Many have more reasonable tuition fees than you will find in the US, yet with a comparable quality of education. It is often possible to apply US federal financial aid toward studies at recognized institutions. Some countries, like the United Kingdom, will even give you a 1- or 2-year work visa upon completion of an advanced degree in their country.\u000a\u000aAnother option might be ''working or interning abroad'', including teaching English abroad. Visit GEO's [[Career page|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2A18AE-0A6B-2220-EA57131A558B072C&Link_ID=1B3AFB7F-CCFB-5B8C-F4E22E5CBC34F1E5&pID=2&lID=21]] for resources and tips for finding an international job!\u000a\u000a<<continue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

V!Opportunities for returned students\u000a!!!!There's sooooo much you can do when you get home!\u000aYour study abroad experience doesn't have to end when you return to the US! In fact, our goal is to ensure that you can extend and process your experience when you return home.\u000a\u000aGEO offers programming specifically created for returning students. We sponsor a ''student organization,'' the Study Abroad Alumni Group, which hosts social dinners and workshops. Our [[annual conference|http://vanderbi.lt/icgrsa]] helps you unpack your experience and/or share your newfound insights about the world with fellow students.\u000a\u000aWhen you return, you can also ''volunteer with or work for GEO''; it's a great way to share your experience with other students. You can also get involved in our own local community: you may be surprised how international Nashville really is!\u000a\u000aStudying abroad can make you a great candidate for ''prestigious honors scholarships'' when you return home. Some of these, such as the Fulbright Fellowship or Critical Language Summer Institutes, may even send you abroad again! These opportunities may require advance planning, though, so we encourage you to study the offerings and discuss your interests with the [[Office of Honor Scholarships|http://ohs.vanderbilt.edu]] //before you leave//.\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[More ideas and resources for getting involved after you return!|Returnee resources]]\u000a   [[What possibilities exist for me to go abroad again after I return?|Going abroad again]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "GEO Photo Contest">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Ethical Photography Abroad">>\u000aAs a representative of Vanderbilt, your home country, and the global community at large, you have a responsibility to follow ethical and respectful photography practices. Be mindful of the message your final product sends as well as the impact it has on the host culture.\u000a\u000aDefinitely ''get permission'' to photograph human subjects: There are cultures where people consider photography rude or a violation of modesty, or believe that the camera can be harmful to health. And in all cultures there are people who just don't like to be photographed! Don't be afraid to ask for permission, though, or let it stop you from shooting. Instead consider asking for permission as opportunity to make a connection, have a conversation, and to demonstrate your interest in the people of your host country!\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself before you snap that picture|\u000a|Does the photo make fun of the culture or people of my host country?|\u000a|Does this picture tell a false story about my host country or its people?|\u000a|Does the subject mind that I'm photographing them?|\u000a|What message does this photo send about how I spent my time abroad?|\u000a\u000a''More resources:''\u000a[[Guidelines for Culturally Sensitive Photography|http://www.culturosity.com/pdfs/CulturallySensitivePhotography.pdf]]\u000a[[Breaking Free from the Viewfinder|http://www.melibeeglobal.com/2012/09/photography-while-on-study-abroad-breaking-free-from-the-viewfinder/]]\u000a\u000a<<continue "What to do next">>\u005c

V!Reverse culture shock\u000a!!!!Be prepared for coming home to be a bumpy ride\u000aIt may seem like a distant reality now, but part of the study abroad experience is returning home. There are many students who tell GEO that this is harder than expected, and often harder than going abroad to begin with!\u000a\u000aLook, reverse culture shock is a fact. Returning home after a significant period of time abroad is in some ways just like going abroad. You have changed, your perceptions have changed, and you are now used to living in and interacting with a different culture. You may even find that readjusting to life in the US is more difficult than the initial adaption to your host country! Instead of ignoring this reverse culture shock, learn about it and about effective ways to combat it. Rest assured, there are many resources that may be helpful as you make the adjustment to being back at home. You can find some resources on GEO's website (under [[Reverse Culture Shock|http://vanderbi.lt/reversecultureshock]]); you might want to bookmark it for when you come back! We're also listing some right here.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources for Reverse Culture Shock|\u000a|[[Top 10 Challenges Faced on Returning from Study Abroad|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/challenges_returnees.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Adjusting to Life Back Home|http://www.studyabroad.illinois.edu/resources/return/adjusting_home.aspx]]|\u000a|[[Common Challenges and Coping Strategies|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/returneechallenges.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Tips for Family and Friends on Welcoming a Student Home|http://www.du.edu/intl/abroad/pdf_docs/twelvetips_parents.pdf]]|\u000a|[[Small Planet Studio, an online community for study abroad alums|http://www.smallplanetstudio.com/]]|\u000a|[[Melibee Global|http://www.melibeeglobal.com/]]|\u000a\u000a<<continue "Opportunities for returned students">>\u005c

V!GEO's Annual Photo Contest\u000a!!!!Keep the contest in mind as you decide what to photograph!\u000aEvery year, GEO conducts a photo contest. We solicit photos from students who went abroad in the 12 months previous and choose the best images to feature.\u000a\u000aWe will contact you via email, usually in the summer, to request your entries in the contest. \u000aThere are prizes, but we also invite the entire Vanderbilt campus and alumni community to take part in the judging process. If you're a winner, your photo will be seen by tens of thousands of people! We put the winning photos on live exhibit in the Student Life Center, and they tend to show up in campus publications as well, including //Vanderbilt Magazine.//\u000a\u000aPhotos can be of any subject (scenery, activities, cultures, etc.) but please be tasteful and respectful as you snap your pics.\u000a\u000aIf you just want to share photos of your experiences without entering the contest, we have an outlet for that, too!\u000a\u000aGEO is particularly keen on photos that show Vanderbilt students participating in academic and cultural endeavors. Scenery is beautiful, but action shots with Vandy representatives (such as yourself) tell interesting stories!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box>>\u000a   [[Quick guidelines for ethical photography|Ethical photography]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "What to do next">>\u005c

V!Preparation and responsibilities\u000a!!!!Get ready to go abroad, and to take advantage of opportunities when you return\u000aThere are many things that you need to do to prepare to go abroad. GEO can't help you manage all of them, of course, but we have prepared a checklist of things to do not only before you leave, but also while you're abroad and after you return to the US. (Later in this presentation, we'll also discuss tips for packing, traveling with prescription drugs, and other topics.)\u000a\u000aIn addition to responsibilities, the checklist also highlights opportunities you can prepare for or take advantage of.\u000a\u000a<<if $summer and (not $maymester)>>[[Summer Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=12585]]\u000a<<elseif $maymester>>[[Maymester Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=12584]]\u000a<<else>>[[Semester Responsibilities & Opportunities Checklist|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=11244]]\u000a<</if>>\u000a<<continue "Conduct and law">>\u005c

V!Making friends\u000a!!!!Consider your goals as well as your opportunities\u000aStarting off in a foreign country is in some ways like being a first-year student again. //Everything// is new, including all of the other students. Most study abroad programs offer orientation activities at the beginning of the semester. Take advantage of social opportunities during this orientation. It's your best chance to get to know the other participants, and it's not hard--luckily, they happen to be in the market for new friends too!\u000a\u000aWhile it will be great to have friends in your program, you should be aware of the disadvantages of spending too much time with other Americans. If your goals include meeting local people, learning the language, or becoming something more than a long-stay tourist, you will need to look beyond the American crowd.\u000a\u000a<<continue "Making local friends">>\u005c

V!Making __local__ friends\u000a!!!!Get involved--outside your comfort zone!\u000aGEO strongly encourages our students to get to know local people and students in more than superficial ways. Not only does this provide the greatest opportunities for building cross-cultural and language skills, it will also give you a more meaningful experience. But getting to know locals can seem daunting. Here are some tips!\u000a\u000aIn most countries, your visa or residence permit will allow you to ''volunteer'' in the community or even do an ''internship'' or other paid work: fantastic ways to immerse yourself in the local community while also beefing up your resume! If you have questions about whether you can volunteer in your country, [[contact GEO|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=1B2936BD-9D45-883A-02A56AC77951A353&Link_ID=1B34B64E-9B4D-6FCE-D278333739D84B5D&pID=1&lID=5]].\u000a\u000aIf you will be living with a ''host family'', explore the opportunities provided by their wider social network. They likely know people that you might like to get to know!\u000a\u000aIf you are enrolled in or taking classes at a university, join ''student organizations'' on campus. Your campus probably has many clubs and intramural sports, and joining up is a great way to find locals who share your interests.\u000a\u000aVisit your university's ''office of international student services''. In addition to local knowledge about bus routes and student discounts, they may offer inexpensive excursions and other social opportunities.\u000a\u000aMost important, ''put yourself out there!'' It may be uncomfortable at first, but it will pay off in the long run!\u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "Homestays">>\u000a   [[Gifts and relationships|Gifts and relationships]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u000a\u000a<<continue "Before you leave">>\u000a

V<<sidebar "Gifts and Relationships">>\u000aPresenting a gift shows that you place importance on a relationship. Consider a gift to start off your more important relationships abroad, such as with your homestay family or a host-country roommate.\u000a\u000aIn a cross-cultural setting, the best gifts can be those that let you bring a little of where you're from to the relationship. Examples might include a Vanderbilt mug or pendant, a photo book about Nashville or your hometown, maple syrup if you're from Vermont, or maybe biscuit or grits mix if you're from the South. Not only are gifts like these polite, positive, well-meaning gestures, they can also spur conversations ("Is a biscuit the same thing as a scone?")\u000a\u000aPhotos of home are another great conversation starter. Make sure you have along some photos of your family, your house, your campus, your hobbies, etc. It's a great way for people to feel like they are getting to know you and where you come from. \u000a\u000a<<continue "Before you leave">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Academic systems abroad">>\u000aHigher education and academic systems abroad can vary greatly from what you are used to in the United States. Here are some things that might be different depending on the country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Differences in academic systems abroad|\u000a|There are fewer hours spent in the classroom, and students are expected to spend more time studying on their own. This doesn't mean that there will be assigned homework! A lot of responsibility for deciding how best to spend your homework hours may be left up to you.|\u000a|Depending on the course and level you are taking, and whether you are taking it in a foreign language, you may need to spend extra time learning and mastering the material.|\u000a|There are fewer tests and quizzes, and students may earn a grade based on just one final exam, or a mid-term and a final. This means you'll have less chance to gauge how a professor grades in the weeks or months before an exam.|\u000a|Professors are less accessible for office hours, and by email.|\u000a|Classes may be more lecture-style than discussion-based. This may leave fewer opportunities to ask questions or express your opinions.|\u000a|There may not be much sense of privacy attached to grades. For example, the instructor might post all exam grades publicly. In some places, individual grades may be discussed openly in class.|\u000a|The prevailing academic culture may well be very different. For example, students may not be as concerned--or concerned at all--about getting high grade point averages.|\u000a|In some places, such as Latin America, students pursue something like a strict professional degree, without a liberal arts component. They may have a much more focused academic experience.|\u000a|Students likely do not live on campus, which may mean that you need to meet people through academics at first, or join a club.|\u000a|<hr>//Every country is different!

V!Identity and diversity\u000a!!!!Research beliefs, attitudes, and experiences\u000aOur surroundings shape us and help to define who we are. Living in another cultural context will give you the chance to explore many facets of your identity, and to consider them in light of new surroundings. Students overwhelmingly tell us that this process leads to increased personal growth and insight. However, it often carries difficulties too.\u000a\u000aAs you gear up for your time abroad, prepare yourself for how people in your new culture will perceive your identity. Just as in the US, people abroad will have beliefs, myths, stereotypes, and prejudices about aspects of personal identity. You may also find that the way(s) in which you identify yourself in the US differ from how others will identify you abroad.\u000a\u000aResearch the viewpoints held by people of your host country, including beliefs, laws, and customs that revolve around nationality, race and ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, mobility, and more. You may be able to prevent or at least alleviate cultural misunderstandings by learning as much as you can about your host culture before leaving. But also prepare for how your time abroad might change, challenge, and strengthen your identity. \u000a\u000a<<sidebar-box "More Specific Topics">>\u000a   [[Being American abroad|Being American abroad]]\u000a   [[Gender roles abroad|Gender roles abroad]]\u000a   [[Race and ethnicity abroad|Race and ethnicity abroad]]\u000a   [[Sexual and gender identity abroad|Sexual and gender identity abroad]]\u000a   [[Religious identity abroad|Religious identity abroad]]\u000a<</sidebar-box>>\u005c\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!You might be surprised to learn...|\u000a|The components of identity that most impact the treatment of students abroad are ''nationality'' and ''gender'', no matter what their background.|\u000a\u000a<<continue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Race and ethnicity abroad">>\u000aDepending on who you are and where you are going, you may feel a part of a racial or ethnic majority for the first time in your life. Or you may have the opposite experience, becoming a racial minority in one fell swoop. Either way, you will likely find that your ethnic or racial identity has different implications in your new host country than it has at home. \u000a\u000aThese new vantage points on self and identity can be exciting, but they can also be difficult. People may consistently misidentify you based on physical appearance, for example. Or you may be surprised at how freely people comment on appearance. If your appearance is very exotic for your host culture, you may find that you are stared at, or that people want to touch your hair or skin.\u000a\u000aOr, it's possible that your physical appearance and racial or ethnic identity is almost totally ignored, and all that really seems to matter is your nationality and gender.\u000a\u000aIf you are traveling to a location that is part of your own heritage, be aware that people there may not see your heritage as the most important thing about you. If you are from the US, you may find that people there identify you as an American first. You should be prepared to be considered an outsider.   \u000a\u000aFor all of these reasons, it will be wise to prepare yourself in advance for the attitudes on race and ethnicity held by people of your host country. Do some research, and also see whether talking with alums of the program might help.

V<<sidebar "Sexual and gender identity abroad">>\u000aIf you identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, or intersex, you will want to take time to consider whether and how you plan to be out abroad. Depending on where you are traveling, your destination may provide you with either a more open environment than the US, or a much less welcoming one. Either way, be prepared: make yourself aware in advance of local attitudes, beliefs, and understandings. Ask yourself questions like the following:\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions for LGBTQI Students to Consider:|\u000a|What behaviors are legal in my host country? If I am interested in activism, are there ways to practice it both safely and legally?|\u000a|<hr>Is it safe for me to be out in my host country and city?|\u000a|<hr>How open do I want or need to be about my gender or sexual identity while abroad? Do I plan to be out? How specifically will I reconcile my human rights with the cultural values of my host country?|\u000a|<hr>If my destination is one where I need to conceal my identity, how will this impact my experience?|\u000a|<hr>What are the cultural norms surrounding friendship and dating in my host culture?|\u000a|<hr>What norms surround publicly identifying as LGBTQI in my host culture? How does my self-presentation "read" in my host culture's system of gendered norms and expectations?|\u000a|<hr>What is the LGBTQI community in my host city like? How is it different from the community at home?|\u000a|<hr>What on-site resources will I have if I experience any issues/concerns while I am abroad? Are there LGBTQI organizations or other resources at my host university or in my host city?|\u000a|<hr>Do I have concerns about my housing situation? (If living with a host family, consider making the housing coordinator aware that you would like a host family that has hosted LGBQTI students in the past.)|\u000a|<hr>Might I face challenges with travel and documents due to my gender presentation?|\u000a\u000aRegardless of self-identification, all students should be aware not only of local attitudes and beliefs surrounding sex and sexual identity, but also of local laws. Some countries criminalize speech as well as behavior, and you need to be well informed about matters that could affect your safety and well-being. The [[ILGA website|http://ilga.org/]] is a good resource for checking on legal regimes around the world. \u000a\u000aStudy abroad is often a time when students explore identity and selfhood. If you are not out at home and are considering being out abroad, please make doubly sure that you do your research and ensure that your safety and well-being are provided for. If you will live with a homestay family and want to be out to them, consider telling the housing coordinator in advance that you would like an LGBQTI-friendly family.

Coming to know and understand this new culture will likely be exciting and rewarding, but like any process of cultural adaptation it may also be trying at times.

V<<sidebar "Gender roles abroad">>\u000aExpectations surrounding gender roles vary from country to country, and even within countries. Because so much of our communication with others is interpreted in terms of gender, it is helpful to learn something about gender roles in your host culture. One of the best things about study abroad is making new friends, and you will want to avoid undue friction due to misunderstanding and miscommunication.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Things to think about include:|\u000a|Americans are accustomed to having non-romantic friendships with the opposite sex. How does your host culture view opposite-sex friendships?|\u000a|<hr>If you are considering being sexually active abroad, research safe sex and birth control practices as well as attitudes toward sex outside marriage.|\u000a|<hr>What constitutes sexual harassment under local law or understanding?|\u000a|<hr>How do locals dress on the street? What might your manner of dress communicate to them about you?|\u000a\u000aWhile men studying abroad will certainly see cultural differences in their roles, it is women who will need to adapt most to local norms and values. North American women should be aware that they may face special sets of attitudes and assumptions.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Women may want to further research questions like these:|\u000a|In some countries (particularly Latin countries), catcalls or other forms of harassment of women might be common. Is this sort of think likely in your country? How will you deal with it if so?|\u000a|<hr>What behaviors might be construed as sexual? Smiling or greeting strangers? Looking directly at others? Going out at night without a companion of the opposite sex?|\u000a\u000aIt can be useful to talk with [[study abroad alumni|https://webapp.mis.vanderbilt.edu/studioabroad/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewDocument&File_ID=9604]] of your host country about what they've experienced.

V<<sidebar "Religious identity abroad">>\u000aReligion is a prominent feature of cultures around the world, even in countries that are officially atheist. During your time abroad, you will likely encounter fascinating and enriching ideas and practices. You may also experience things that challenge your notions of spiritual truth or even basic fairness. \u000a\u000aIf you plan to practice your own religion abroad, do some research first. You'll want to know whether there are convenient houses of worship, of course. But depending on where you are going, there may be safety issues to consider as well.\u000a\u000aIn some countries, there may be little commitment to religious pluralism. The state may sanction a religion. Or laws may restrict religious speech, particularly as it relates to political activism. In China, for example, it is illegal to use religion to "disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of the state."\u000a\u000aEven if the society is generally an open one, be aware that safety concerns may still exist. Just as in the US, wearing symbols of some religions, or even frequenting houses of worship, may make you a target for passionate violence from other groups. \u000a\u000aWhatever your personal beliefs and circumstances, remember that your primary purpose is studying abroad. Consider your experiences an opportunity to understand the historical and social dimensions of religion in your host country. Be open-minded, save critical impulses for later, and open your own beliefs and practices to the same degree of scrutiny. If you approach your time in your host country as a time to learn about others' beliefs and attitudes, you can avoid many opportunities for conflict.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Questions to ask yourself|\u000a|Is there a dominant religion in my host country?|\u000a|<hr>What laws exist pertaining to religion? Are there strong societal practices that, while not codified in law, might shape religious practice?|\u000a|<hr>How tolerant is my host country of religious diversity?|\u000a|<hr>How tolerant is my host country of nonbelief (i.e. atheism, agnosticism)?|\u000a|<hr>Where can I practice my religion?|\u000a|<hr>How safe is it for me to wear symbolic expressions of my religion in public?|\u000a|<hr>How can I accommodate my dietary requirements abroad?|\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Pluralism Project|http://www.pluralism.org/reports/links]], bibliography of research and websites on world religions|\u000a|[[International Religious Freedom|http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper]], the most recent report from the US State Department on religious freedom around the world|\u000a|[[Jewish Travel Advisor|http://jewishtraveladvisor.com/]], world-wide listing of kosher hotels and restaurants, synagogues, mikvaot, and Jewish communities around the world |\u000a|[[Halal Trip|http://www.halaltrip.com/city-guide-all]], website focused on Muslim travelers and including city guides with a focus on halal dining|\u000a\u000a<<continue "Contacts and communications">>\u005c

V<<sidebar "Being American abroad">>\u000aIf you grew up in the US and identify as American, your American-ness will probably be the most important factor in how natives of your host country relate to you. (This is true no matter what your background.) While other components of your identity may well be important factors, the fact that you are American will be a critical component of your identity abroad.\u000a\u000aBe prepared to encounter curiosity and interest. America's unique economic, political, and cultural position in the world mean that people all around the world take an interest. You may be asked all sorts of questions, from what it's like to live in America to what you think of politics and other issues in the US. (The FBI has recently warned that American students abroad may also be the target of espionage recruitment.)\u000a\u000aMost interest you receive will probably be friendly, even if frankly or passionately expressed! But do prepare yourself to encounter actual hostility as well, and to consider how you might handle it.\u000a\u000aIn many places, people may assume that because you are American, you are also rich. Or they may have other assumptions, based on media portrayals, local history with US policies or intervention, or other sources. Do some research before you go so that you can have some idea of what being an American might mean in your host country.\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Quick tip|\u000a|In some parts of the world, you should be careful about referring to yourself as "American." The entire Western Hemisphere is properly called America, and in Central and South America people may find the term "American" arrogant when used for just one country. Plan on referring to yourself as North American (//norteamericano//) instead.|\u000a\u000a|box|k\u000a|!Resources|\u000a|[[Diversity Issues in Study Abroad|http://www.smith.edu/studyabroad/docs/diversity_st_abroad01.pdf]]: A booklet that collects statements of Brown University students about their experiences of identity abroad.

V<<sidebar "More on credit cards">>\u000aEurope and much of the rest of the world are moving to chip-and-PIN (or EMV) "smart" credit cards. These cards offer more secure transactions by adding an embedded microchip and replacing easily forged signatures with the entry of a PIN number.\u000a\u000aStudents should be able to function abroad with a regular US swipe card, which are still accepted by most businesses. However, US swipe cards are not likely to work at most self-serve kiosks.\u000a\u000aDepending on your bank, it may be possible for you to get a chip-and-PIN card in the US for use overseas. If you decide to explore this route, be aware that there is a difference between chip-and-PIN and chip-and-signature cards. Chip-and-signature cards will not work in automated kiosks abroad, for example.\u000a\u000aRegardless of whether you choose a chip-embedded card, you may want to shop around for banks and credit card companies before you leave. Seek out cards that carry low foreign transaction fees, as well as debit card providers with overseas partnerships that allow for lower ATM fees.\u000a\u000a<<continue "Where will you live?">>
